    after various models they’ve launched in the past that go by the title GPT. Generative
    Pre-trained Transformer is referred to as GPT. The word “Generative” in the first
    half of the word relates to the kind of language model that it is, so what it
    really does is try to determine, in response to a prompt, what text to generate
    next that would be most believable given all the text that it has already seen.

    of information and data, but getting that isn’t always simple. Students and researchers
    are still figuring out the best use cases for ChatGPT, the popular chatbot based
    on a powerful AI language model. This Chapter will demonstrate how to utilise
    ChatGPT for research and how it may improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and

    AI language model. Co-authors are often those who have contributed significantly
    to the research endeavour, such as through data collection, experimentation, analysis,
    and interpretation of results. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a tool that can
    help with some areas of the research process but cannot significantly advance

    you might include ChatGPT in your paper’s acknowledgments section or describe
    how you utilised it in the methods section to help with your study.
