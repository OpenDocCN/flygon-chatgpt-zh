- en: '**“Other people’s money.”** In B2B, the spending dynamic differs from B2C.
    While consumers normally spend their own money on themselves, B2B involves “spending
    other people’s money on other people,” borrowing a concept from famed economist
    Milton Friedman. This leads to a shift in buying criteria, where factors like
    quality and value are often outweighed by more personal factors. Decision-makers
    can often face additional work, change-management challenges, the need for consensus,
    and the risk of the personal consequences of bad decisions, all of which can deter
    them from adopting new solutions. The disconnect between personal costs and business
    benefits poses a difficult barrier for firms seeking to displace incumbent suppliers.'

  zh: '**“别人的钱。”** 在B2B中，支出动态与B2C不同。虽然消费者通常为自己花钱，但B2B涉及“为别人花别人的钱”，借用著名经济学家弥尔顿·弗里德曼的概念。这导致了购买标准的转变，其中质量和价值等因素往往被更个人的因素所取代。决策者往往面临额外的工作、变革管理挑战、达成共识的需要以及糟糕决策的个人后果的风险，所有这些都可能阻止他们采纳新的解决方案。个人成本与企业利益之间的脱节为寻求取代现有供应商的公司设置了难以逾越的障碍。'
- en: '**Loss aversion.** Loss aversion, a concept from behavioral economics and prospect
    theory, significantly influences B2B decision-making. People tend to fear losses
    more than they value comparable gains. This aversion to losses creates a reluctance
    to deviate from the status quo. Switching to a new vendor or approach introduces
    personal risks, such as reputational damage or job insecurity, which normally
    outweigh the potential personal benefits. Fear of losses and the associated personal
    risks often hinder the adoption of new behaviors or solutions in the B2B space.
    Loss aversion and risk aversion are both much stronger forces in B2B than in B2C.
    The consequences of this reality are less-than-optimal decisions in B2B where
    “not losing” is vastly more influential than the prospect of winning. As an example,
    many of us over the age of forty have heard the phrase “Nobody gets fired for
    buying IBM,” a notion which perfectly captured this pervasive force.'

  zh: '**损失厌恶。** 损失厌恶是行为经济学和前景理论中的一个概念，它在B2B决策中起着重要作用。人们往往对损失感到恐惧，而不是看重相当的收益。这种对损失的厌恶导致了不愿偏离现状。转向新的供应商或方法会带来个人风险，如声誉受损或工作不稳定，这些风险通常超过潜在的个人利益。对损失和相关个人风险的恐惧通常阻碍了B2B领域新行为或解决方案的采纳。损失厌恶和风险厌恶在B2B中都是比在B2C中更强大的力量。这种现实的后果是B2B中做出的决策不够理想，其中“不输”远比赢的可能性更具影响力。例如，我们中许多超过四十岁的人听过这样的说法：“没有人因为购买IBM而被解雇”，这个观念完美地捕捉了这种普遍的力量。'

- en: Companies often mismatch their sales-and-marketing messaging to the real drivers
    for B2B decisions. With a B2C mindset, they often market their products and services
    as if the decision-maker cared about their product or service the same way they
    might care about a new car, purse, or golf club. Brand marketing is more important
    and effective in B2C, where consumers care more deeply about the product they’re
    buying. However, while B2C marketing heavily relies on emotional connections and
    brand perceptions, B2B decisions are largely driven by personal-loss aversion
    and justifications based on the company’s performance. B2B customers frankly care
    less about the product itself and more about how it will impact them personally
    and/or benefit the company. Because of these key differences, lead generation
    and prospecting are vastly more important in B2B than brand marketing, especially
    for SMBs.

    playbooks and are often lost in practice today. As a note, this trend is especially
    common in engineering-dominant firms. Effective B2B sales and marketing requires
    a distinctly different approach than B2C. The resistance to change, the dominance
    of loss aversion, and the focus on bottom-line impacts shape the B2B decision-making
    process. As an important conclusion, B2B marketers should prioritize lead generation
    and prospecting over brand marketing, especially in SMBs. In modernizing and retailoring
