    will host more than 200 meetings in more than 50 places for 32 separate work streams.
    Since every G20 country’s leader, staff, and citizen will attend, India extensively
    relies on digital technology for living, working, learning, obtaining information,
    and communicating with one another. Prior patterns of closeness are unlikely to
    recur, and daily living will increasingly incorporate virtual connections and
    Discussion. Yet, as our reliance on technology increases, threat actors will have
    more chances to perform cybercrimes or spread false information that undermines
    the Global Level Summit’s profile of global leaders. This is different from defending
    India against cyberattacks. India must create a strong cyber strategy to defend
    the G20 Summit’s guests from these evil deeds. GPT is a potent language model
    that may be applied in a variety of contexts to increase effectiveness use to
    Counter Cyber Attack During the G20 Summit.

    significant as a media event. The topic of hacking is being raised more frequently
    as a result of the rise in recent years in the use of digital networks as a forum
    for political opposition (Used by hacker groups like *Anonymous, Lulzsec, the
    Honker Union, Wikileaks,* and others).

    with various languages and cultures, and language difficulties are extremely important.
    The summit offers a forum for debating and resolving global concerns, including,
    among others, global health, commerce, and economic development. To guarantee
    that everyone can participate completely in the talks, comprehend the problems,
    and come to an agreement on the best course of action, effective communication
    is essential.
