    who walk but do not lose are opportunities. Artificial intelligence is not simply
    a course, first-hand technology, a product, or an application, but a comprehensive
    ecosystem (AI ecosystem) with profound theory, vibrant technology, traction of
    product landing, and application empowerment of society. To strengthen the practical

    on the properties of the data and to categorize the data. In the process of step-by-step
    response, a typical decision tree analysis will use hierarchical variables or
    decision nodes. Classification and regression issues are frequently solved using
    the decision tree approach. Take clothing purchase as an example, first determine
    whether you like it, don''t buy it if you don''t like it, look at the price if
    you want it, don''t buy it if the price is not suitable, check whether there is
    a right size if it is suiconvenienton''t buy it if you don''t havan appropriate
    size, and buy it if it is available, Based on the above selections, a simple stump
    structure can be drawn.Scenario examples: rule-based credit evaluation, horse
    racing result predictionStrengths: Good at evaluating a range of different characteristics,
    qualities, characteristics of people, places, thingsCommonly related algorithms:

    Boosting Machine (GBM)Random forest:  The random forest algorithm improves the
    accuracy of decision trees by using multiple trees with randomly selected subsets

    neurons. We can regard a neuron as a classifier, and the network of many neurons
    can classify samples many times.CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) convolutional
    neural network is a feed-forward neural network. Its artificial neurons may respond
    to nearby units within a portion of the coverage area, performing well for large-scale
    image processing.Pros: Convolutional Neural Networks are helpful when there are
    large datasets, a large number of features, and complex classification tasksScenario
    examples : image recognition, text-to-speech, drug discovery, photo filters, face
    recognition, driverless cars, etc.RNN Recurrent Neural Networks) recurrent neural
    network, in any neural network, each neuron converts many inputs into a single
    output through one or more hidden layers. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) pass
    values ​​further layer by layer, making layer-by-layer learning possible. In other
    words, RNNs have some form of memory that allows previous outputs to influence
    later inputs.The recurrent neural network is a general term for two kinds of artificial
    neural networks: time recurrent neural network (recurrent neural network) and
    the structural recursive neural network (recursive neural network). The connection
    between temporal recurrent neural network neurons is a directed graph, while structural
    recurrent neural networks utilize similar neural network structures to recursively
    construct more complex deep networks. The algorithms trained by the two are different
    but belong to the same algorithm variant. Based on RNN, algorithms such as LSTM
    (Long-Short-Term-Memery) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) have been derived. These
    algorithms can remember the past, so they can be used to process some data with
    time series attributes. Therefore, it has unique advantages in processing language,
    text, etc. LSTM and GRU have the same advantages as other recurrent neural networks
    but are more commonly used because they have better memory capabilities.Pros:
    Recurrent neural networks have predictive power in the presence of large amounts
    of ordered informationScenario examples: image classification and subtitle addition,
    political sentiment analysis, dialogue robot, machine translation, natural language
    recognition of iFlytek, article editing, etc.'

    essence of a thing, you can rely on the occurrence of events related to the specific
    nature of the item to judge the probability of its essential attribute. When we
    find several such features and then use these features to combine them, we can
    consider them. Common algorithms include the Naive Bayesian algorithm, Averaged
    One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN).For example,

    and analyze their characteristics. We find that the word "cheap" appears frequently,
    and this word appears in 40 of the 100 spam emails. Then we use this cognition
    to conclude: if there is "cheap," there is a 40% probability that this email is

    identical. Clustering techniques often integrate input data centrally or hierarchically.

    of shots is used to adjust and optimize the algorithm continuously. Finally, the
    algorithm knows that in a specific situation, action can be taken to obtain the
    best result. His essence is to solve the "decision-making problem," that is, to
    learn to make decisions automatically and get the optimal result after making
    continuous decisions and getting feedback. For example, monkeys "learn" to do

    then combine the results for overall prediction. The ensemble algorithm's key
    challenge is determining which separate and more fragile learning models to connect
    and how to integrate the learning outcomes.We want to make models that perform
    better in all aspects of machine learning. But often, the reality is that our
    models have preferences and may only work better for specific situations. So,
    now, we want to combine several such models to get a better and more comprehensive
    model. This method is It's called ensemble learning. Common algorithms include
