- en: OpenAI has recently announced the development of its latest system, GPT-4\.
    This new system represents a significant step forward in the field of natural
    language processing and is set to surpass its predecessor, GPT-3, in terms of
    its capabilities and performance. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 is their most advanced
    system to date and is designed to produce responses that are not only more accurate
    and informative but also safer and more useful. This means that the system is
    designed to prioritize generating responses that are beneficial and helpful to
    users while minimizing the risk of generating harmful or misleading information.
    This version is currently available on ChatGPT plus and, through its API available
    to the users. It has been made multimodal with image, text-in, and text-out queries.

- en: GPT-4, the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort to scale up deep learning, has
    been created by us. A large multimodal model that accepts image and text inputs
    and emits text outputs, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional
    and academic benchmarks, although it is less capable than humans in many real-world
    scenarios. For example, a simulated bar exam was passed with a score around the
    top 10% of test takers, whereas GPT-3.5 scored around the bottom 10%. GPT-4 has
    been iteratively aligned for 6 months using lessons from our adversarial testing
    program as well as ChatGPT, resulting in our best-ever results (though far from
    perfect) on factuality, steerability, and refusing to go outside of guardrails.

    publications of exam editions and olympiads test cases, along with many other
    important testing benchmarks. It performed exceedingly well in many exams, especially
    better than GPT - 3.5.

    models training available and which may include benchmark-specific crafting or
    additional training protocols, against some potential benchmarks. GPT-4 almost
    outperformed the other models significantly.

    and can go through visual reasoning and logic extracted from a picture. It can
    even perform **visual question answering (VQA)** tasks with a good perfection,
    with similar capabilities like it does for textual data.

    OpenAI’s internal evaluations indicate that GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond
    to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses
    than GPT-3.5\. More human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users,
    was incorporated to improve GPT-4’s behavior. Additionally, over 50 experts were
    worked with to provide early feedback in domains, including AI safety and security.
    Lessons from real-world use of previous models have been applied to GPT-4’s safety
    research and monitoring system for continuous improvement. Similar to ChatGPT,
    regular updates and improvements will be made to GPT-4 as more people use it.
    GPT-4 was utilized to help create training data for model fine-tuning, and classifiers
    were iterated across training, evaluations, and monitoring.

    by the market and domain experts. Some organizations have already collaborated
    to build innovative products on GPT-4\. A lot of technical details are yet to
    be revealed and to be explored. The world is eagerly anticipating the full potential
    of GPT-4 and its utilization across all domains and skills.
