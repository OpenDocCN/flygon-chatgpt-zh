- en: 'CHAPTER 4Create unique covers with AIImagine that, thanks to ChatGPT’s help,
    you have finally finished your masterpiece. The plot, the characters, the emotions…everything
    has been perfectly designed and structured. But what about the cover? Had you
    forgotten? Remember that a good cover can make the difference between the success
    and failure of a book. However much we try to avoid it and however much it hurts,
    the truth is that we can’t help judging a book by its cover.Wouldn’t it be amazing
    if ChatGPT, after helping you write a real masterpiece in record time, could also
    help you with this important element? After all, a book without a cover is an
    unfinished book.However, as we saw in chapter two, ChatGPT can “only” provide
    ideas for your cover. It can’t design the cover itself. But what you can do is
    ask it to prepare a description or detailed prompt for each of these ideas, which
    you can then use to design your cover using other amazing AI tools.I’m talking
    about the AI image generating programs that have become so popular lately: DALL-E,
    Midjourney, Bing Image Creator…the list goes on.All you have to do is copy the
    cover description that ChatGPT produced for you, paste it into one of these image
    generation programs, and – as if by magic – you will have your cover ready in
    under five seconds.Not convinced by the first result? Go back to ChatGPT, tell
    it what you didn’t like and ask it to produce a new description. Or you can try
    using one of the other ideas it prepared. In addition, I recommend you repeat
    the process with different AI image generation programs. You might love one for
    designing a realistic cover and find that another does a better job for an illustrated
    children’s book.If at first, your attempts are more Picasso in his abstract phase
    than the professional cover you had in mind, don’t worry. Just like with ChatGPT,
    to get the best results out of these AI image generation programs, you need a
    little practice.Remember, AI is just a tool: a means to an end. You are the one
    who gives it direction, meaning and purpose. As such, don’t be afraid to experiment,
    try different combinations, think outside the box. Be brave! Feel proud of every
    Picasso painting that comes your way. Because each of them gets you closer to
    that perfect cover for your book.'

  zh: 第四章使用人工智能创建独特封面想象一下，借助ChatGPT的帮助，你终于完成了你的杰作。情节、人物、情感...一切都被完美地设计和构建了。但封面呢？你忘了吗？记住，一个好的封面可以决定一本书的成功与失败。无论我们如何努力避免，无论伤害有多深，事实是我们无法不以貌取书。如果ChatGPT在帮助你在短时间内写出一部真正的杰作后，还能帮助你处理这个重要元素，那岂不是太神奇了？毕竟，一本没有封面的书是一本未完成的书。然而，正如我们在第二章看到的，ChatGPT“只能”为你的封面提供想法。它不能设计封面本身。但你可以要求它为每个想法准备描述或详细提示，然后你可以使用其他令人惊叹的人工智能工具来设计你的封面。我说的是最近变得如此流行的AI图像生成程序：DALL-E、Midjourney、必应图像创作者...名单还在继续。你所要做的就是复制ChatGPT为你生成的封面描述，粘贴到这些图像生成程序中的一个，然后
    - 就像魔术一样 - 你的封面将在不到五秒钟内准备好。对第一个结果不满意？回到ChatGPT，告诉它你不喜欢什么，并要求它生成一个新的描述。或者你可以尝试使用它准备的其他想法。此外，我建议你用不同的AI图像生成程序重复这个过程。你可能会喜欢其中一个用于设计逼真封面，而发现另一个更适合插图儿童书籍。如果一开始，你的尝试更像是毕加索的抽象阶段，而不是你心目中的专业封面，不要担心。就像对待ChatGPT一样，要想从这些AI图像生成程序中获得最佳结果，你需要一点练习。记住，人工智能只是一个工具：达到目的的手段。你是那个给它方向、意义和目的的人。因此，不要害怕尝试，尝试不同的组合，打破常规。要勇敢！为每一幅毕加索画感到自豪。因为每一幅画都让你离那本书的完美封面更近一步。
