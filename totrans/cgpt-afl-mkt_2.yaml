    campaign to determine which one performs better. It is also known as split testing
    and is an effective way to optimize and improve marketing efforts. A/B testing
    is a statistical experiment that allows marketers to compare two versions of a
    website or marketing campaign by splitting the traffic into two groups, Group
    A and Group B.

    The website’s homepage is the first point of contact for visitors and is therefore
    critical to the website’s success. The website’s management team decided to conduct
    an A/B test to determine which version of the homepage leads to a higher conversion
    rate.

    led to a higher percentage of website visitors completing the desired action.

    be large enough to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the
    two homepage versions. Ideally, A/B tests should be run on larger sample sizes
    to ensure statistical significance and reduce the likelihood of false positives.

    to the difference in conversion rates between the two versions. For example, were
