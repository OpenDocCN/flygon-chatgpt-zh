- en: Language Models are a groundbreaking innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
    They are AI systems designed to understand, generate, and interact with human
    language, and their prowess is rooted in a special deep learning[¹](#ftn1a) architecture
    known as Transformers, which were introduced in 2017\. Transformers employ a unique
    attention mechanism, enabling them to discern the relevance of words within an
    input sentence when generating an output sentence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leveraging this pioneering approach, OpenAI, initially established as a non-profit
    AI research laboratory[²](#ftn2a) in the US, launched the first Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer (GPT-1) in 2018 with 117 million parameters[³](#ftn3a). The GPT-1
    model employed a simplified left-to-right version of the Transformer architecture,
    which enabled it to generate the next word in a text sequence based on the context
    of the preceding words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout its training process, the model worked to predict the subsequent
    word in a sentence, given a specific lookback window of previous words and their
    respective degrees of importance for the new word. It compared this prediction
    with the actual next word in reference texts from its dataset of 7000 books (BooksCorpus),
    making adjustments to its internal mechanisms whenever discrepancies were identified.
    When the predictions were accurate, no adjustments were needed. BooksCorpus was
    chosen partly because the long passages of continuous text helped the model learn
    to handle long-range dependencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GPT-1 achieved notable improvements over previous models in tasks such as text
    classification, natural language inference[⁴](#ftn4a), question answering, commonsense
    reasoning, and semantic similarity[⁵](#ftn5a).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    GPT-2 in 2019\. This second iteration demonstrated a significant upscale in the
    number of parameters, soaring from GPT-1’s 117 million to 1.5 billion. Additionally,
    GPT-2 utilized a larger training dataset of 8 million web pages or 40GB of text,
    which was over ten times larger than that of GPT-1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GPT-2 introduced significant improvements over GPT-1, particularly in zero-shot
    learning[⁶](#ftn6a) and text generation. The model can create high-quality synthetic
    text based on any given input, adapting to the style and content seamlessly, allowing
    for coherent and realistic text continuations on user-chosen topics. GPT-2 also
    outperforms GPT-1 in other text generation tasks like translation and summarization,
    as well as in text understanding tasks like question answering and reading comprehension.

    or 570GB of text, from various datasets including CommonCrawl with approximately
    6 billion crawled web documents, WebText2 with approximately 45 million web pages,
    Wikipedia, and a large number of public domain books. The significant scale-up
    resulted in capturing more intricate linguistic patterns and granted GPT-3 superior
    text generation and understanding capabilities, rendering GPT-3 an evolutionary
    leap beyond GPT-2.

    learning capabilities. Thus, GPT-3 was able to perform well on new tasks based
    on limited examples, with only a handful, or even just one, input-output example
    without the need for explicit re-training or fine-tuning on large domain-specific
    datasets.

    in June 2023, allowing them to interact with external tools via the generation
    of API function calls. Before delving deeper, it’s essential to draw a clear distinction
    between plugins and this new feature. The previous subchapter extensively discussed
    plugins, which are specific enhancements that need to be officially registered

    are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management),
    and SCM (Supply chain Management) systems. Expanding their reach further, GPT
    models can also interface with enterprise-specific search engines, intranet sites,

    generate specific function calls instead of natural language when certain conditions
    are met. These models are skilled to check these conditions on each user input
    and, if met, create the respective function calls that match the expected format.
    The main program simply needs to execute the function call and handle its results,
    which could involve another prompt to a GPT model to provide a summary in natural
    language, which then could be displayed to the user.
