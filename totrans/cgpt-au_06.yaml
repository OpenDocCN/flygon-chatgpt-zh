- en: 'CHAPTER 6Passive income and ChatGPTAre you tired of your nine-to-five? Do you
    dream of a life where your words pay your bills while you sleep, travel or simply
    sit back with a cup of coffee?I’ve saved the best till last. Because writing books
    is great. But living off your books is A-MA-ZING.So, fellow writer…welcome to
    the exciting world of passive income!Passive income is not a faraway dream in
    a utopian world of writers, but a reality that is tangible and accessible for
    anyone willing to take action.Herein lies the secret, because you might be wondering:
    “If it’s so easy and so good, why isn’t everyone doing it?”. And that’s precisely
    why: because not everyone is willing to take action.Because passive income, however
    amazing it is, requires initial work. Work that, whether out of fear or out of
    laziness, most people are not prepared to do.Enter your new adventure companion,
    ChatGPT.Are you too lazy or simply don’t have enough time to do that initial work
    of writing the book? No excuse now. ChatGPT does it for you, without asking for
    time off or lunch breaks.Are you afraid you’re not good enough or that you don’t
    have the necessary knowledge to write a book that can generate a new source of
    passive income? ChatGPT will be your expert in whatever field you choose.Okay,
    so ChatGPT will enable you to multiply both the number of books you can write
    and their quality, but where does the money come in?There are so many ways you
    can monetize your books and create passive income from them, but without a doubt,
    the most potent, the one that is changing the world and my personal favorite,
    as you already know, is self-publishing.What is self-publishing?Self-publishing
    is the process by which the writer themselves publishes their book without relying
    on a publishing house. This way, rather than selling the rights to a third party
    and receiving a percentage of the sales, the self-published author keeps all the
    rights to their book and receives all the earnings from it.The process is very
    simple, and it’s also free. All you have to do is upload your manuscript to one
    of the many self-publishing platforms available (Amazon, Google Play, Kobo...)
    with a couple of clicks, and wait for your paycheck at the end of the month.Why
    is self-publishing better than using a publishing houseBasically, it’s a matter
    of control and profit.When you opt for self-publishing, you gain control and freedom.
    No publishing house is going to tell you whether your book is worthy of being
    published, decide what parts to change or remove, impose a sale price on you or
    tell you your publication date.With self-publishing, the author is the one who
    decides whether a book is worth publishing, when to do it, where to do it, and
    – very important – what price to sell it at.And, of course, when you decide to
    self-publish, you go from receiving a measly ten per cent of the sales of your
    books to charging no less than sixty per cent!How to make the most of self-publishingTo
    maximize the potential of your passive income in the world of self-publishing,
    there are three key points you need to keep in mind: self-publishing a lot (with
    quality), self-publishing well (following a tried-and-tested system), and self-publishing
    everywhere:1\. Self-publishing a lot (with quality)Is it possible to write a good
    book and have it fail to bring in profit? Yes, it’s possible. I’m sure there are
    true masterpieces out there that fell into oblivion.Is it possible to write a
    hundred books and not even be able to cover your Netflix subscription? Without
    a doubt, Amazon is full of examples of this.Is it possible to write twenty good
    books and not be able to live off them? Statistics say no. And, in addition, they
    say you can live very well off them. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the Facebook
    community “[20booksto50k](https://www.facebook.com/groups/20Booksto50k/)”.The
    best thing about this first point is that, thanks to ChatGPT, writing twenty good
    books is no longer something only in reach of a talented few with a gift for words
    and a lot of free time. Now, it’s available to anyone who really wants it and
    has a good guide, like the one you’re holding in your hands.2\. Self-publishing
    wellAs I say in [Successful Self-Publishing](https://soykevinalbert.com/ssp-serie):
    “Self-publishing is easy…self-publishing a book and having it not seem self-published
    is trickier.”I’m sure that if you’re reading this book, you’ve already mastered
    that part, so I won’t get off track and spend the next twenty pages explaining
    it to you again. But just in case you haven’t, and you would like to know more
    about this topic, you can ask Google or ChatGPT... or write to me at [books@soykevinalbert.com](mailto:books@soykevinalbert.com)
    and ask me to give you my book for free. I’d love to.3\. Self-publishing everywhereI’m
    sure you’ve heard it’s a bad idea to put all your eggs in one basket.It’s a saying
    that means you shouldn’t depend solely on one source of income, or that you shouldn’t
    place all your hopes and efforts in one investment or project.That’s exactly why
    self-publishing is my favorite strategy for generating passive income. Because
    once you have your manuscript ready, you can put it in as many baskets as you
    want without needing to invest your time or money, thanks to aggregators.An aggregator
    is a self-publishing platform that enables authors to publish and distribute their
    books globally in over four hundred physical and digital bookshops, including
    of course the 5 big ones: Amazon KDP, Google Play, Apple Book, Kobo y Barnes and
    Noble Press.The two best-known aggregators are Draf2Digital and PublishDrive.
    The main difference between them is that with Draf2Digital, you pay 10% commission
    on every book sold and if you don’t sell you don’t pay, while with PublishDrive
    you pay a fixed monthly fee regardless of whether you sell or not, but they don’t
    keep any percentage of your sales.Multiply your profitsI’m sure you know that
    most self-publishing platforms accept several formats for books: paperback, hardback,
    e-book and audiobook[4](part0034.xhtml).I understand that, if transferring your
    book into all these formats would involve a considerable time or money investment,
    you might decide only to publish in your preferred format or the one you think
    has the most sales potential. But since it’s an automatic process, why are there
    so many self-published authors with only one or two formats on sale?!Don’t let
    that happen to you. If you want to multiple your potential sources of income by
    four, don’t forget to publish your books in all four formats.And if multiplying
    by four isn’t enough for you, don’t forget step two from my DTP[5](part0035.xhtml)
    method: translate!Because now, thanks to ChatGPT, you can translate your book
    into any language in a matter of minutes.Even if you decide to hire a professional
    translator, ChatGPT can be a great ally in the process of reviewing and correcting
    translations. Don’t get ripped off.If you do your homework and use ChatGPT in
    the right way, I promise that, just like it is for me, self-publishing can become
    your golden goose, capable of freeing you from the shackles of the nine-to-five
    much faster than you can imagine.You know now: the only secret is taking action.'
