    to hone. The Scene Analysis Prompt is designed to facilitate this by providing
    a structured, in-depth evaluation of your writing through the lens of a developmental
    editor. By employing the “Three Story Method Scene Rubric” this prompt ensures
    a comprehensive review of key storytelling elements, guiding authors towards creating
    resonant and effective narratives.

    By identifying the wants, needs, conflicts, choices, and consequences within a
    scene, authors can gain clarity on their characters’ motivations and the overall
    direction of their story. This not only aids in creating more engaging content
    but also simplifies the editing process. With a clear understanding of the scene’s
    purpose and dynamics, editors can provide more targeted feedback, ensuring that
    the narrative remains consistent and impactful.

    You’ll need to use the “Advanced Data Analysis” option because that will allow
    you to upload your scene as a Word document. You can copy/paste the prompt from
    any document, or use Text Blaze to store your prompts and insert them with keyboard
    shortcuts. I’ll show you how to do that in the “Tool – Text Blaze” section at
    the end of the book.*'
