    capabilities for lightening your load. By using the right prompts, you can get
    ChatGPT to streamline your meetings and deal with the business they generate,
    such as agendas beforehand and reminders and follow-ups afterward. ChatGPT can
    also help you get your email under control and assist you with planning and arranging
    travel.

    as though they''ve hired an intern or an assistant. On the plus side, ChatGPT
    costs far less than an intern (assuming that you pay your interns — and that you
    pay for ChatGPT), has near-infinite patience, and won''t show up to work late
    or blitzed. On the downside, ChatGPT won''t fetch your coffee — but you can prompt
    it for tips on how to brew better coffee, how to cut down your caffeine intake,
    or even both.  ## Streamline Your Meetings'
