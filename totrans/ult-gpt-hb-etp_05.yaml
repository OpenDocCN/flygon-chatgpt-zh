    which each of the three subsequent task prompts for Task 1, Task 21 and Task 3
    are interpreted. Each of these tasks can be handled by a different employee and
    involve several interactions with ChatGPT until the final respective task output
    is achieved. Task 21 is followed by a sequence of further tasks, Task 22, Task
    23 etc. until Task 2N, with each of them receiving all previous prompts and outputs
    as context. Once the context grows beyond the context window size of the used
    GPT model, the task-specific part needs to be summarized, while the master prompt

    foundation, while the task-specific prompt gave the immediate scenario. This dual-prompt
    system enabled a precise and empathetic client interaction. By integrating decision
    theory, the agent was guided to prioritize the client’s immediate security and
    well-being, subsequently introducing relevant banking products that may provide
    added security or benefits. As a reflection of rational choice theory, the solution
    catered to both the client’s immediate concerns (securing their financial assets)

    The individual task prompts can originate from various employees, ensuring that
    diverse expertise and viewpoints are harnessed. The collaboration repository,
    as outlined in the architecture pattern D3 in *[Chapter 4](c04.xhtml)*, plays
    a pivotal role in this process. It preserves the collaboration context by consistently
    storing the entire context after each new prompt and subsequently reloading it
    for the next collaborative task-specific prompt. This ensures that the thread
    of discussion and collective knowledge is never lost, paving the way for cohesive
    and informed decision-making.
