- en: Although ChatGPT has the ability to provide a general overview or analysis of
    the information, it may not capture all of the nuances or provide an in-depth
    examination in the same way that a real professional with years of experience
    would. Additionally, it is possible that the information it provides is not always
    accurate or up to date; therefore, it is essential to independently verify the
    contents.

    be representative of the perspective held by all professionals working in the
    relevant sector. Be aware that the analysis that is provided by ChatGPT is based
    on patterns found in the text data that it has been trained on, and that these
    patterns may not represent a position that is widely held.

- en: Restricted access to content If you ask the AI to review or analyze a book or
    piece of content that was released after ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff date (September
    2021), it's possible that it won't have access to the particulars of that work.
    In situations like this, the AI might come up with a response based on previous
    experiences with similar works or general area knowledge, but this answer might
    not be completely accurate or pertinent.

- en: In conclusion, employing the "act" mode can be useful for acquiring an initial
    analysis or perspective from a particular professional position. This can be done
    by using the "act" mode. It is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is only
    an AI model and not a real person. It is possible that the information it provides
    is not always correct or up to date because its responses are based on patterns
    found in the training text data. Always conduct additional research to verify
    the information provided to you by other people.
