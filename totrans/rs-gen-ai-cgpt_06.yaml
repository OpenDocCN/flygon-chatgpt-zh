    and unsupervised learning across many modalities, be it textual, or imagery, or
    vocal, maybe across different types such as numerical data, contextual data, feature-based
    data, pattern-based data. **Natural language processing** (**NLP**) has been one
    of the subdomains in the arena of Artificial Intelligence which only captures
    almost 1/5th market share and number of solutions, focusing on the interaction
    between computers and human language.

    and generate human language. It is one of crucial segments of AI which deals with
    the linguistic tasks and automates the process of analyzing and getting meaningful
    context out of any phrase. The tasks involve sentiment analysis, context-mapping,
    chatbots, content predictions, captioning, answer generation, machine translation,
    content classification etc and are used across different industries like banking,
    finance, customer service, health and medical, educational and almost in every
    other entity. NLP has made significant advancements in recent years, thanks to
    the availability of large datasets, powerful computing resources, and advanced
    machine learning algorithms. With its ability to process and understand human
    language, NLP is helping to bridge the gap between humans and machines and making
    our interactions with technology more intuitive and natural.

    war II where urgency translation was reflected. Back to the 1950s when researchers
    began to explore the possibility of using computers to understand and generate
    human language. In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the “Turing Test,” a benchmark for
    machine intelligence that involved a computer’s ability to carry on a conversation
    that was indistinguishable from a human. This led to the development of early
    NLP systems, such as the “ELIZA” program developed in the 1960s, which simulated
    a conversation between a computer and a human therapist.

    as the “SHRDLU” program, which could understand natural language commands and
    manipulate virtual objects in a simulated environment. In the 1980s and 1990s,
    researchers focused on developing statistical models for language processing,
    which allowed computers to learn from large datasets of human language.

- en: One of the most significant developments in NLP has been the emergence of large
    pre-trained language models such as **BERT** (**Bidirectional Encoder Representations
    from Transformers**), GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), and GPT-3\.
    These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and can perform a wide
    range of NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, and language
    generation. They have enabled researchers to achieve state-of-the-art results
    on a variety of NLP benchmarks.

    where models are first pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned for
    a specific task. This approach has been used to achieve high performance on a
    variety of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
    and text classification.

    more sophisticated and accurate language-based applications, from chatbots to
    virtual assistants, and are likely to have far-reaching implications for many
    industries in the years to come. From then, LUNAR- scientific qualitative data,
    ELIZA - the first chatbot, from the complex models and use cases of today’s date
    such as smart Alexa, conversational bots is Siri with high-level complex neural
    networks at backend. In the context of ChatGPT, it’s one of the modern advanced
    NLP architectures developed, which is able to perform very high level tasks with
    more quantitative and qualitative accuracy and precision, closer to human perceptions
    and interpretations. In between, there has been a gradual yet constant development
    of the process of improvement from Word2Vec model to today’s ChatGPT through neural
    networks, LSTM models, encoder-decoder, Attention models, Transformer model, Google’
    BERT, imageBERT.

    neural network architecture that underpins ChatGPT with their version 3.5 of the
    GPT series( known as InstructGPT), being their most recent development. The Transformers
    model, created by Google in 2017, is the foundation and the preliminary element
    for this GPT model. It is based on the intuition of the attention-based model
    that was first presented in the paper “**Attention is all you need**.”

    hyper-parameter adjustments by openAI and they have been improvising on many micro-level
    changes. The entire GPT-3 consists of approximately 175B parameters in its entire
    model which is around 50x higher than the language model that Google introduced
    in 2018, BERT; though there are some heavily loaded language models available
    in the research of NLP - like Megatron-NLG, by NVIDIA, with 530B parameters which
    is composed of 560 DGX A100 servers, each containing eight A100 80GB GPUs, capable
    of auto-completing phrases and statements. Google’s PaLM scaled to 540B parameters
    is another example of such a highly multi-tasking NLP model, trained on the largest
    TPU of the world with 6144 chips. Google also introduced LaMDA; in contrast to
    the task-based replies that conventional models frequently provide, the model
    may produce conversational chat in a free-form manner, which also has around 137B
    parameters. The following bubble chart by *Dr Alan D. Thompson* blog series explains
    about the estimation on recent developments of heavy load models with large parameters
