    (MIT) and published in the Journal of Technological Advancements found that people
    who use ChatGPT are approximately 37% more productive than those who do their
    work manually. That’s a massive boost in efficiency!

    was mostly the same. With its ability to process information quickly, ChatGPT
    can help you save time on tasks that’d otherwise take hours to complete. Whether
    doing research, generating content, or data analysis, it can do those tasks in
    a fraction of the time a human would do it.

    You’ll agree that spending hours scrolling through search results and filtering
    out irrelevant content can be frustrating. But what if you can simplify this process
    and quickly get the necessary information? This is precisely what ChatGPT does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just initiate a prompt that gives general information on your topic of interest.
    Then, ChatGPT will provide you with relevant information and resources to dive
    deeper into your research. Easy right? And the best part is you can do it without
    sifting through sponsored posts and annoying ads irrelevant to your search.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, you might think, “How is ChatGPT better than Google or other knowledge-based
    tools?” Well, the answer is simple. It’s because of the way it works. On traditional
    search engines, you must rely on other users to post relevant information based
    on their experience, knowledge, and likes. However, with ChatGPT, you have the
    whole AI-language model at your fingertips, waiting for your commands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means you can ask ChatGPT any question, which will give you an answer based
    on its vast knowledge base. But there’s a catch! You have to be specific with
    your questions. If you give ChatGPT a generic query, it will give you a generic
    response. However, if you want some answers, you must give it all the necessary
    instructions to set the ‘rules.’ That includes the type of work, style, audience,
    etc.

    to get what you want. The better you use ChatGPT, the better the result you’ll
    get. But don’t fret! You don’t have to be an expert. With practice, you’ll learn
    how to tweak your ChatGPT inputs to get your desired answers.
