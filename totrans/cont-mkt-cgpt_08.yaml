    as it allows the storing of generative AI prompts as text snippets, which can
    be easily inserted into context windows using keyboard shortcuts. By saving a
    snippet, assigning a shortcut to it, and typing the shortcut, the snippet gets
    auto-filled, streamlining the writing process by reducing repetitive typing, which
    is particularly handy for frequently used generative AI prompts.

    inside your browser, and with a keyboard shortcut that you designate, you can
    instantly add text to any text box or form on a webpage, including the ChatGPT
    context window.

    and when you’re ready to work in ChatGPT, simply type the keyboard shortcut you’ve
    assigned for that prompt, and Text Blaze fills the ChatGPT context window with
    your prompt. Amazing!
