- en: The term "black box" refers to the difficulty in interpreting how complex neural
    networks, like ChatGPT, arrive at their conclusions.

- en: Due to the large number of layers and connections within the network, it can
    be challenging to trace the decision-making process that leads to a specific output.

- en: Imagine the pizza-making process happening inside a sealed box. You can see
    the ingredients going in and the finished pizza coming out, but you can't observe
    the intermediate steps. In the same way, we can observe the input and output of
    a neural network, but the inner workings remain opaque.

- en: ChatGPT relies on machine learning and neural networks to process and generate
    text. It's built on Transformer architecture, which excels at natural language
    processing tasks, thanks to self-attention mechanisms.

- en: The model is trained using self-supervised learning, learning from vast amounts
    of text data. Tokenization helps break down text into smaller units, while semantic
    layers in the neural network allow the model to understand language at various
    levels of abstraction.

    to interpret its decision-making process.
