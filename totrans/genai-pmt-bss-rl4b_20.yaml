    In most cases, three things are needed:Subject: what do you see?⦁ Details and
    setting: what is it about?⦁ How should style, artist(s), and media type look?A
    simple and concise input language should always be used. A complete, grammatically
    perfect sentence, for example, would assist the model in understanding the context
    of the input and producing a corresponding image; if the information contains
    ambiguity or errors, the image production will suffer.Explain what should exist
    rather than what is absent.If you want to avoid having a bearded man, don''t write
    "a man without a hair" but "a bold man.” The AI takes things literally; thus,
    if something is in the prompt, it will most likely recreate it. However, remember
    that ambiguous plural words like "cats" leave much opportunity for the text-to-image
    AI to interpret, so we recommend entering a maximum of three subjects.It''s also
    vital to know what language the model was written in because different languages
    have varied word ordering, which can affect image production. If you utilize a
    text-to-image generator with built-in machine translation, expect many things
    to be corrected due to incorrect translation.If you want to maximize the effectiveness
    of your prompt, English is recommended when using: Stable Diffusion, DALL.E, DALL.E2,
    Midjourney, or Dreamstudio.The Stable Diffusion algorithm was programmed on a
    LAION-5B subset, which contains 2.3 billion image-text pairs in English and 2.2
    billion image-text pairs from over 100 other languages; this means you are not
    limited to the Western European alphabet. The result can vary greatly depending
    on the AI''s country of origin. For example, AIs programmed with data from a specific
    country will likely know artists from that country.If you use a Latvia AI, he
    will have more knowledge of Russian and Eastern European artists. The advice is
    to select the best text-to-image generator for the specific look you are trying
    to produce. Also, remember that AIs are bias based: remember those image databases
    on which an AI generator has been programmed may contain discrimination based
    on their training.More Tips Consider When Creating Effective AI Image PromptsHere

    it may not understand the relationships (of the meaning) to generate the final

    items, or adding more items.
