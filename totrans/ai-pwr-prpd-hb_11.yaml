- en: If you're a coder, you know that it's easy to get lost in the search for answers
    to coding questions. One minute you're trying to solve a particular problem, the
    next you're several hours deep into a rabbit hole of new resources, tricks, and
    clever code. While these discoveries can be useful, they can also be a significant
    drain on time and productivity. This is where ChatGPT comes in. With its ability
    to provide quick and accurate answers to coding questions, ChatGPT can help you
    cut through the noise and get back to focusing on your original task. And if the
    first solution doesn't work, ChatGPT can offer workarounds and alternative solutions
    to help you get back on track. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting
    out, ChatGPT can be an invaluable tool for improving your productivity and efficiency.

    Even if your code is functional, it's not truly complete until the documentation
    is finished. Fortunately, ChatGPT can assist with documentation as well, providing
    guidance on best practices and offering templates and tools to make the process
    smoother and more efficient. With ChatGPT's help, you can ensure that your code
    is fully documented and ready to be used by others.

    an example, if you were to stumble upon some unfamiliar code while browsing through
    old media on an old computer, you could turn to ChatGPT for assistance in deciphering
    its purpose. This would simplify the task of understanding the code.
