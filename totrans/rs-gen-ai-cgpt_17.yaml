- en: Qualitative problem-solving is an approach that focuses on understanding the
    underlying principles and concepts behind a problem before attempting to solve
    it. This approach is often used in fields such as science, engineering, and business,
    where complex problems require a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
    and relationships between variables. Qualitative problem-solving involves breaking
    down a problem into its fundamental components and analyzing them from multiple
    perspectives to gain a holistic understanding of the problem. This approach often
    involves using qualitative data such as observations, interviews, and case studies
    to identify patterns and relationships between variables. One of the key advantages
    of qualitative problem-solving is that it allows individuals to identify and address
    the root causes of a problem rather than simply treating its symptoms. This approach
    is particularly useful in complex problem-solving scenarios where the underlying
    causes of a problem may not be immediately apparent.

- en: This qualitative approach can unleash a way of different perspectives to examine
    a particular problem and might help in approaching or developing many theoretical
    concepts. ChatGPT, being a generative AI tool, can actually progress on solving
    primitive logics to get a foundational output. Though it’s not well adapted with
    human-level qualitative analysis and its opinion is just collected as part of
    its learning data, yet it can grasp concepts and build on the top of it with immediate
    effect. Only in problem solving, it also helps in processing the problem, approaching
    ideas with focused vision and more clarified objectives. This can also help any
    research community or management community to manage their research or corporate
    projects in a very skillful manner.
