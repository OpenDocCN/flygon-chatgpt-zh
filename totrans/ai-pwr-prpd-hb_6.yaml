  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sami intends to launch his own business based on an app he has already created.
    The app, which is similar to Instagram, enables users to take photos and share
    them exclusively with family members. It is designed to provide greater privacy
    for its users by remaining separate from social media platforms. The app requires
    a subscription fee, but it guarantees parents and children that their personal
    moments will stay private and only shared with people close to them. He wants
    to call it FamilyGram.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that the app is developed and ready and able to run on Android and iPhone,
    Sami does not know what to do next, so he asks ChatGPT what are the next steps.
