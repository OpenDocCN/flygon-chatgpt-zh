    in 2007\. Since January 2023, when ChatGPT went viral, it has become the fastest-growing
    app in history, with the website hitting 100 million active users in just two
    months.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 by Open AI as a language-based chatbot
    fine-tuned for human interaction. Chatbots are artificial intelligence systems
    capable of engaging in spoken or written conversations. I guess you’re already
    familiar with them on customer service sections of many websites and virtual assistants
    like Siri and Alexa.

- en: But what is ChatGPT?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest way to describe ChatGPT is that it is an AI system that engages
    in dialogue. The “GPT” stands for “Generative Pre-training Transformer,” basically
    about how ChatGPT processes language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT is distinct and unique from the hundreds of chatbots developed over
    the past decades, and it was trained based on reinforcement learning from human
    feedback. This is called RHLF, meaning ChatGPT is trained with human AI trainers
    and reward models so that it can challenge inaccurate assumptions, answer follow-up
    questions, and admit when it makes mistakes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In essence, ChatGPT operates by collecting data written by people across the
    internet and making computing predictions to answer user queries. Its generated
    replies are prompted by information and requests, from which it learns more about
    various subjects and how to engage in a dialogue about them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a pre-trained generative chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP),
    ChatGPT gets its data from websites, textbooks, and online articles. And it uses
    that data to model its language for engaging in human-like dialogue.

    would, making it suitable for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI system
    conversations.

    human-like text based on a given prompt or dialogue.” It further says that because
    its training data is based on human conversations, it can understand intent and
    context and have natural, intuitive conversations.

    example, you can ask, “Can you provide insights into effective goal-setting techniques
    that can enhance productivity and motivation?” or “Five things to like about New
    York?” There are no limitations to what you can ask ChatGPT.

    to read the context and understand the details, and admit when it makes mistakes.
    Naturally, there are concerns about ChatGPT, especially regarding its reliability
    and inaccuracy problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    limitations. For instance, even though it’s great at technical language, I don’t
    recommend relying on ChatGPT for health information above the input of a licensed
    medical professional. It is best used for less serious issues, such as content
    generation.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI is the abbreviated form of “Artificial Intelligence,” which makes machines
    and computers perform automated tasks using intelligence like human beings. The
    two main components of AI are Automation and Intelligence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three stages of artificial intelligence. The first is Machine Learning,
    a set of algorithms AI systems use to learn from experience. Next, we have Machine
    Intelligence and advanced algorithms intelligent machines used to learn from experience.
    The third and final stage is Machine Consciousness, which refers to self-learning
    by AI systems from expertise without needing to be trained on existing data. We
    have yet to advance to this stage of AI.

- en: Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows
    computers and machines to understand human language. It may be defined as “the
    ability of machines to understand and interpret human language as it is written
    or spoken.” It exists to create systems that can understand texts and perform
    tasks such as spell check, translation, topic classification, and conversations.

    language) communicate. It also seeks to make computers process language in the
    same way as human beings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of sentences, then using algorithms to extract meaning and create outputs. In
    simpler words, it processes human language to perform tasks automatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most popular applications of NLP are virtual assistants such as Siri, Google
    Assistant, and Alexa. NLP entails how virtual assistants understand written or
    spoken texts, such as “Hey Siri, where’s the closest restaurant to me?” It transforms
    your text into numbers so that machines can understand it.
  prefs: []

    support and help solve issues by processing common language requests and giving
    automated responses.

    when drafting an email, the translate feature when you come across a tweet in
    a different language, the automatic filter of promotional emails into the spam
    folder. All of these are possible, thanks to NLP.

    as it is – easy for machines to understand.

    human language. With it, AI systems can understand written and spoken text and
    perform tasks automatically.

    machine learning. This is the process of feeding algorithms to machines to teach
    them how to learn and improve from experience on their own, without explicit programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, AI-powered chatbots use NLP to interpret what you say and what
    you intend to do, and machine learning to create more accurate responses by learning
    from previous interactions. This is how ChatGPT can admit mistakes and make corrections
    on its own and with human feedback.
