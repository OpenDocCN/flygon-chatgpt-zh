这里是一个学生关于幸福写作的糟糕尝试，她的拼写不太好，语法也不是最好的。

* * *

每天我们都在完全混乱中寻找幸福，这就是我们奋斗的目标。实际上，如果我们愿意寻找并追求，暂时的幸福无处不在。有时它就在我们身边，就像一只可爱的小猫，有时候给予需要我们的人一只手就足够了。有时甚至只是呼吸也可能给某人带来绝对的幸福。但如果我们放下暂时的幸福，决定建立在永久幸福的基本原则上的生活呢？当然，这些原则取决于一个人的特点和观点。在我看来，社会关系、接受和独立是生活中永久幸福的最重要元素。

首先，社会关系对我来说在我生活的总体趋势中非常重要。我应该与我周围的人保持良好的关系，以保持内心的平静。如果我有亲密的朋友，可以与他们分享我的烦恼、忧虑和喜悦，那么这意味着我在很大程度上战胜了生活的压力。在我看来，拥有真正朋友的人拥有了生活中最宝贵的财富。为了获得这个宝藏，我选择那些原则与我相似、特点最适合我的、真诚的人作为我的朋友。除了朋友，我还努力与我每天在某种程度上遇到的人保持良好的关系，比如邻居、熟人、老师、亲戚等。

对我来说，持续幸福的第二个元素是接受：换句话说，接受我的特征、行为、选择和欲望。在某种程度上，它可以被定义为接受我作为一个真实个体的存在。只要我被接受并被接纳，我就能为自己做出正确的决定。为了实现这一点，我解释说我不希望周围的人对我进行不必要的批评。除非我做的事情或想法影响到任何人，否则其他人不应该干涉。他们无权干涉我只关乎我的事情。

总之，如果我在社交关系、独立性和接受方面取得成功，那就意味着我拥有了使幸福成为我生活中持久元素的黄金钥匙。获得所有这些元素可能并不容易，它们可能只能在长期内实现，但有一点我们应该牢记，实现生活中真正和持久的幸福并不容易。

review this essay and correct it like a teacher showing where the mistakes are and what can be done to improve  it and grading it:

Everyday we try to find happyness in a complete caos, that's what we struggle for. Actually, temprary happyness is evrywhre if we want to find it and search for it. Sometimes it is just as close as a cute kitn to us, sometimes givin a hand to someone who is in need of us is enough. Even takin a breth may give somebody the absolute happyness at times. But what if we leave temprary happyness alone and decide to constrct our lives on basic principls of permanent happyness? Cirtainly these principls depend on one's charactaristics and point of view. In my opinion, social relations, acceptance and independence are the most important elemnts of permanent happyness in life. To begin with, socal relations are very important for me to be happy in the general drift of my life. I should have good relations with the people around me for peace of my mind. If I have close and intimate frends with whom I can share my trubbles, woris and also my joy, then it means that I have beaten the life up to a very considerable point. In my opinion, someone who has real frends has the most valuable treasure of life. In order to obtain this treasure, I make my frends among the people whose principles resemble mine, whose characteristics best suit me and who are sincere. Besides frends I try to have good relations with the people I encounter somehow everyday, like neighbors, acquaintances, teachers, relatives and the others. The second elemnt of continuous happyness for me is acceptance: to clarify, acceptance of my characteristics, behaviors, choices and desires. At one point, it can be defined as the acceptance of my existence as a real individual. As long as I am accepted and taken as I am, I can make right decisions for myself. To accomplish this, I explain that I don't want unnecessary criticisms from the people around me. Unless the things I do or think affect anybody, the others should not poke their nose into them. It is none of their business to interfere with me about the subjects that only interest me. To sum up, if I aquire success in social relations, independence and acceptance, then it means that I have the golden key to make happyness an enduring elemnt of my life. Obtaining all these elemnts may not be very easy, they may be achieved only in the long run but there is something we should always bear in mind, achieving the real and permanent happyness in life is not that easy, either

Essay Review:

Every day, we try to find happiness in complete chaos, and that's what we struggle for. Actually, temporary happiness is everywhere if we want to find it and search for it. Sometimes, it is just as close as a cute kitten to us, sometimes giving a hand to someone who is in need of us is enough. Even taking a breath may give somebody the absolute happiness at times. But what if we leave temporary happiness alone and decide to construct our lives on basic principles of permanent happiness? Certainly, these principles depend on one's characteristics and point of view. In my opinion, social relations, acceptance, and independence are the most important elements of permanent happiness in life. To begin with, social relations are very important for me to be happy in the general drift of my life. I should have good relations with the people around me for peace of my mind. If I have close and intimate friends with whom I can share my troubles, worries and also my joy, then it means that I have beaten life up to a very considerable point. In my opinion, someone who has real friends has the most valuable treasure of life. To obtain this treasure, I make friends with people whose principles resemble mine, whose characteristics best suit me, and who are sincere. Besides friends, I try to have good relations with the people I encounter somehow every day, like neighbors, acquaintances, teachers, relatives, and others. The second element of continuous happiness for me is acceptance: to clarify, acceptance of my characteristics, behaviors, choices, and desires. At one point, it can be defined as the acceptance of my existence as a real individual. As long as I am accepted and taken as I am, I can make right decisions for myself. To accomplish this, I explain that I don't want unnecessary criticisms from the people around me. Unless the things I do or think affect anybody, the others should not poke their nose into them. It is none of their business to interfere with me about the subjects that only interest me. To sum up, if I acquire success in social relations, independence, and acceptance, then it means that I have the golden key to make happiness an enduring element of my life. Obtaining all these elements may not be very easy. They may be achieved only in the long run, but there is something we should always bear in mind: achieving real and permanent happiness in life is not that easy, either. Grading:

This essay shows a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument about the importance of social relations, acceptance, and independence for achieving permanent happiness. However, there are several spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, which can make it difficult to understand in some places. For example, "temprary happyness" should be "temporary happiness," "evrywhre" should be "everywhere," "kitn" should be "kitten," "freinds" should be "friends," and "elemnts" should be "elements." To improve the essay, the writer should focus on proofreading and correcting these errors before submitting the final draft. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the argument. Overall, the essay is well-written and thoughtful, and the writer has done a good job of conveying their ideas about the topic. Grade: B

Last summer, I had the opportunity to travel to Egypt for 10 days with my family. It was my first time visiting this beautiful country, and I was really excited to explore all the amazing places that I had heard so much about. We started our trip in Cairo, where we spent the first few days visiting all the famous landmarks such as the Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Egyptian Museum. Seeing the Great Pyramids in person was absolutely breathtaking. They are so massive and grand, and it's hard to imagine how they were built so many thousands of years ago. We also went inside one of the pyramids, which was a really cool experience. The Egyptian Museum was also really interesting, with so many artifacts from ancient Egyptian times, including the famous gold mask of King Tutankhamun. In addition to the historical sites, we also visited some modern attractions in Cairo such as the Cairo Tower and the Khan el-Khalili market. The Cairo Tower provided an incredible view of the entire city, and we got some great photos from the top. The market was a bustling and colorful place, filled with shops selling all kinds of goods, from spices to jewelry to souvenirs. After a few days in Cairo, we headed to Sharm El Sheikh, which is located on the coast of the Red Sea. This was a completely different experience from our time in Cairo, as we spent most of our time at the beach and doing water-related activities. The water in the Red Sea is so clear and blue, and we spent hours swimming and snorkeling among the coral reefs. We even went on a glass-bottomed boat tour to see the underwater world from a different perspective. One of the highlights of our time in Sharm El Sheikh was a day trip we took to the nearby desert. We rode camels and ATVs, and even went sandboarding down the dunes. It was a really fun and unique experience that we all enjoyed. Overall, my trip to Egypt was an unforgettable experience. I learned so much about ancient Egyptian history and culture, and also got to enjoy some beautiful natural scenery and modern attractions. It was amazing to see how different the city of Cairo was from the beach town of Sharm El Sheikh, and I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to experience both. I would definitely recommend Egypt as a travel destination to anyone who is interested in history, culture, and adventure.
