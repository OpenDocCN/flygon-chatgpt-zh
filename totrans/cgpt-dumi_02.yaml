    march of technological progression. It's a large language model (LLM) that belongs
    to a category of AI (artificial intelligence) called generative AI, which can
    generate new content rather than simply analyze existing data. Additionally, anyone
    can interact with ChatGPT in their own words. A natural, humanlike dialog ensues.

    Office apps (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) and the Bing search engine. The number
    of app integrations seems to grow every day as existing software providers hurry

    rank information they found buried in massive datasets. You''ll recognize examples

    prioritizing vast amounts of information. For example, the Google search engine
    ranks and returns results from a user’s input of keywords. Generally, users don't
    look further than the first three to five top ranking results. This in effect
    shapes our thinking by limiting the info we ingest and consider. Companies covet
    the top ranking spots for certain keyword results, which is why a huge search
    engine optimization (SEO) industry arose around keywords.

    of previous software programs with which we are more familiar, such as other AI
    forms, search engines, chatbots, advanced analytics, and even business intelligence
    (BI) software. ChatGPT’s accuracy arguably swings more widely than that of the
    more analytical types of software. Although I’ve seen poor outputs from a BI app,
    I’ve never seen one outright lie or hallucinate (generated responses that are
    convincing but completely wrong). But ChatGPT has shown it can do both on occasion.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT differs from those other AI-enabled software categories because of its
    dialog format. Previous chatbots produce responses to natural-language queries
    by selecting from canned responses, meaning the content is prewritten and a response
    selection is triggered by keywords or the content of a user’s question. ChatGPT
    generates its own response to the user’s prompt. To the unsuspecting eye, the
    two types of chatbots may appear the same, but they are not.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interaction with ChatGPT begins with someone typing a prompt in their natural
    language rather than in machine language. This means you can give the machine
    a command or ask it a question without using computer code. ChatGPT responds in
    the same language you’re using. It continues building on the conversation as your
    interactions with it proceed. This threaded interaction appears as a real-time
    dialog and creates the semblance of a conversation or a highly intelligent response
    to your request.
  prefs:

    may need to be limited to prevent this AI model from providing weird responses,
    making errors, or becoming offensive. To prevent this behavior, Microsoft limited
    ChatGPT in Bing to five responses per user conversation. You’re free to start
    another conversation, but the current exchange can’t continue past the capped
    limit.

    stand accused of illegally using copyrighted photos, text, and other intellectual
    property without permission or payment to train their AI models. These charges

    of such charges in the age of AI and requesting that charges be dropped. The lawsuits
    regarding who owns the content generated by ChatGPT and its ilk lurk somewhere
    in the future. However, the US Copyright Office has already ruled that AI-generated
    content, be it writing, images, or music, is not protected by copyright law. In

    AI in terms of rights, licensing, or payment.

    ChatGPT and its kind are known to sometimes deliver incorrect information to users

    language-related tasks. ChatGPT is a chatbot that runs on either model, and it
    is smaller, more accurate, and faster than GPT-3 and GPT-4 in conversational tasks.

    on a conversation with inquisitive people like ChatGPT does.

    by users as offensive or alarming. Unfortunately, the filter fails sometimes and
    lets bad stuff through while over-throttling some acceptable or barely questionable
    content. This behavior is unsurprising because Content Filter is in beta; it's
    expected to improve over time. Users are encouraged to click the thumbs up or

    from technical writing and programming to screenwriting and mimicking the user’s
    personal writing style. However, it still hallucinates just as GPT-3 models do.
