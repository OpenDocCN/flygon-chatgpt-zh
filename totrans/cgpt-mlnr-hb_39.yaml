    may have limits in the area of comprehension or may deliver biased information.

  zh: 理解限制和偏见信息：一些AI模型，如ChatGPT，在理解领域可能存在限制，或者可能提供偏见信息。当指定专业职能时，获得与该行业标准和惯例相符的信息的可能性增加，这有助于减少获得不准确或偏见信息的可能性。
- en: Through the use of the "act" mode, you are able to make a request to ChatGPT
    that it evaluate statements, books, or other information and deliver a review
    from the point of view of a certain professional. This enables you to obtain insights
    from a particular point of view or to comprehend how someone with that knowledge
    could read or analyze the content of the article.

  zh: 然而，还有一些需要考虑的事项：
- en: Although ChatGPT has the ability to provide a general overview or analysis of
    the information, it may not capture all of the nuances or provide an in-depth
    examination in the same way that a real professional with years of experience
    would. Additionally, it is possible that the information it provides is not always
    accurate or up to date; therefore, it is essential to independently verify the
    contents.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 虽然ChatGPT有能力提供信息的一般概述或分析，但它可能无法捕捉到所有的细微之处，也无法像具有多年经验的真正专业人士那样进行深入的审查。此外，它提供的信息可能并不总是准确或最新的；因此，独立验证内容是至关重要的。
- en: The subjectivity of reviews and opinions means that the AI's response may not
    be representative of the perspective held by all professionals working in the
    relevant sector. Be aware that the analysis that is provided by ChatGPT is based
    on patterns found in the text data that it has been trained on, and that these
    patterns may not represent a position that is widely held.

  zh: 评论和观点的主观性意味着AI的回应可能不代表所有在相关领域工作的专业人士所持的观点。请注意，ChatGPT提供的分析是基于其训练数据中发现的模式，这些模式可能不代表普遍持有的立场。
- en: Restricted access to content If you ask the AI to review or analyze a book or
    piece of content that was released after ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff date (September
    2021), it's possible that it won't have access to the particulars of that work.
    In situations like this, the AI might come up with a response based on previous
    experiences with similar works or general area knowledge, but this answer might
    not be completely accurate or pertinent.

  zh: 限制对内容的访问 如果您要求AI审查或分析ChatGPT知识截止日期（2021年9月）之后发布的书籍或内容，可能无法访问该作品的具体内容。在这种情况下，AI可能会根据以往对类似作品或一般领域知识的经验提出回应，但这个答案可能不完全准确或相关。
- en: In conclusion, employing the "act" mode can be useful for acquiring an initial
    analysis or perspective from a particular professional position. This can be done
    by using the "act" mode. It is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is only
    an AI model and not a real person. It is possible that the information it provides
    is not always correct or up to date because its responses are based on patterns
    found in the training text data. Always conduct additional research to verify
    the information provided to you by other people.

  zh: 总之，使用“行动”模式可以帮助从特定专业角度获得初步分析或观点。这可以通过使用“行动”模式来实现。请记住，ChatGPT只是一个AI模型，而不是真正的人。由于其回应基于训练文本数据中发现的模式，因此提供的信息可能并非始终正确或最新。请始终进行额外的研究以验证其他人提供给您的信息。
