    industries that are coming together more and more. By boosting patient outcomes,
    lowering costs, and increasing the overall effectiveness of healthcare systems,
    AI has the potential to transform healthcare. Using algorithms and computer programmes
    to carry out operations that ordinarily require human intellect, such as speech
    and picture recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making, is
    known as artificial intelligence (AI).'
