- en: IN THIS CHAPTER, you set yourself up to use ChatGPT and learn the essentials
    of giving prompts. I suggest you begin by setting up a free research preview account
    so that you can take ChatGPT for a spin without having to pay. You can then start
    prompting ChatGPT for information and evaluate the responses it returns.

    account, which gives you access to the full range of ChatGPT's features.

    A free account enables you to use enough of ChatGPT's features to evaluate it
    effectively. You don't get access to the latest and most advanced features, and
    ChatGPT may respond more slowly when the service is busy, because it gives priority
    to its paying customers.
