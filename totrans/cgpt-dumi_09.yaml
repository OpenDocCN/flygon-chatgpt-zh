    daily life as a result of the ubiquitous adoption of ChatGPT and other generative
    AI models. At least some of these changes will eventually be noticeable even to
    people who don't use ChatGPT, don’t realize that they do, or have never heard
    of it.

    changes are on the way. This chapter outlines a few of the more foreseeable and
    likely changes.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Search engines introduced keywords to our everyday life. Employees, researchers,
    and consumers alike learned that if they wanted to find anything in the broad
    expanse of the internet, they had to figure out which words the search engine
    could best match to content they wanted it to retrieve.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People adapted their lives to accommodate keywords in their personal sphere
    of existence as well. For example, resume formats and job applications changed,
    with distilled content and added keywords so a machine could search, sort, and
    rate candidates. One downside of this practice is that some candidates could be
    the most qualified and still not be considered for the position for want of the
    right keywords. On the flipside, companies looking to hire could miss great job
    candidates because of poorly written job descriptions and requirements that resulted
    in a collection of poor performing keywords that applicants might not think to
    use.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet keywords have persisted because they are useful overall. Beyond sorting
    lots of resumes and job applications quickly, keywords help companies with important
    tasks ranging from research and fact-checking to better-targeted marketing campaigns.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The latter birthed the search engine optimization (SEO) industry. SEO is a process
    that largely depends on the strategic use of keywords to improve the quality and
    quantity of unpaid traffic to a website or web page. But keywords are also used
    to match advertising to online consumers in paid advertising.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are more examples of how keywords became essential and prevalent, of course.
    But for our purposes, you can think of SEO as being a routine and important element
    in our daily lives.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then along came ChatGPT to upend the keyword and SEO cart. Broadly speaking,
    ChatGPT works by predicting the words that will follow the words you used in your
    prompt. That’s why writing great prompts is so critical to getting great results.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative AI models like ChatGPT do not use keywords to work. Instead, they
    rely on complex calculations of word context and meaning plus user intent. Sometimes
    ChatGPT gets that right, and sometimes not, but either way it does so with no
    regard for our heretofore crucial keywords. As a result, keywords and SEO are
    dying.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It won’t be a quick death because mankind has just begun the transition from
    heavy reliance on search engines to dependence on generative AI. The full transition
    will take time, but even so, some will likely hold on to search engine use for
    a variety of reasons. One important reason is to have a way to fact-check ChatGPT
    outputs. This task might require users to discover search engines other than Google,
    Bing, Yahoo!, Baidu, and DuckDuckGo if the big search engines pivot more towards
    generative AI than keyword-based search.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right now, some search engines are integrating generative AI but keeping the
    emphasis on search. Examples include Microsoft’s Bing Chat and Google’s Bard.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if users shift in large numbers towards generative AI chatbots and
    away from traditional search, the search engines will make a more pronounced shift
    too. And that scenario is highly likely just as a matter of user convenience.
    It becomes increasingly likely if generative AI becomes better controlled, meaning
    that it no longer frequently hallucinates (convincingly lies).
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps search engines will adapt and use search functions to provide instant
    fact-checking alongside chat results to add user value and protect their own investments.
    Perhaps they’ll take a different course.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, ChatGPT is also actively integrating search engines via plug-ins.
    One example is WolframAlpha, a knowledge engine specializing in complex mathematics.
    [Figure 8-1](#filepos300827) shows the WolframAlpha user interface with a reference
    to its availability through ChatGPT Plus, the premium version of ChatGPT. Another
    is Expedia, a search engine specializing in travel options and deals.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If ChatGPT holds this course, it could become a superapp, having incorporated
    a lot of other apps, many of which are specialized search engines. It’s a safe
    bet that ChatGPT can predict better keywords for the various search engines than
    you and I can. The quality of ChatGPT results using specialized plug-ins should
    be stellar.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time will tell how search engines and generative AI such as ChatGPT coexist,
    or whether one consumes the other. But in any case, the days of keywords and SEO
    are clearly numbered.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost everyone is familiar with and uses a virtual assistant such as Siri,
    Alexa, Google Assistant, or Cortana. Up until the advent of ChatGPT and its ilk,
    virtual assistants used a different form of AI coupled with automated and keyword-based
    search. Although the algorithms also consider other inputs, such as your location,
    past purchases, and personal preferences, virtual assistants primarily run on
    search engines.

    assistant, uses the Bing search engine, which is now integrated with ChatGPT.
    Meanwhile, Google Assistant, which is tied to Google Search, can benefit from
    integration with Google’s Bard. These virtual assistants, however, may be replaced
    with next generation ChatGPT-like versions. You see where all of this is going,
    right?

    replacement by more powerful generative AI models such as ChatGPT, virtual assistants
    will be able to do far more than they do now. This shift will make them more useful
    in terms of the number and types of tasks they can perform for just about anyone
    using a smartphone, a smart home device, a computer, or an autonomous vehicle.

- en: ChatGPT and other generative AI models are subject to errors, chief among them
    being hallucinations, which is AI parlance for the machine being convinced it's
    correct when its answers are glaringly and indisputably wrong. In addition, human
    biases end up unintentionally transferred to AI models. These are reasons enough
    to be careful about accepting AI outputs at face value.
  prefs:

    spiel propaganda, misinformation, conspiracy theories, manipulative language for
    a hidden agenda, biased information, security attacks, and outright cons.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, it's more important than ever to teach the citizenry of every country
    how to discern factual information from incorrect, manipulative, or malevolent
    narratives. Do not mistake an AI model’s chatty friendliness with it actually
    being a friend. It isn’t. It’s not a person. It’s a tool used by people, and as
    such it's subject to all sorts of mischief as well as helpfulness. I can't stress
    enough why everyone needs to fact-check everything ChatGPT generates.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, be aware that there isn’t just one of any given AI model. Any one model
    brings about many of its kind. Some are the same at the base but trained differently,
    making them whole nother animals, as we say in the South. Others are augmented,
    as Microsoft says it has done to ChatGPT to make Bing Chat.

    how it arrives at its answers. That’s why the industry is working so hard to develop
    Explainable AI. We need AI to tell us how it came to each conclusion so that mere
    humans can better judge and, we hope, control what it does.
  prefs:

- en: Keep all this in mind while working with ChatGPT and its kind. It may feel like
    you're having a private and safe conversation with something very humanlike, but
    ChatGPT is both more and less than that. Stay detached and logical while using
    these models. And always, always check its homework.

- en: Unfortunately, along with convenience comes a narrowing of options. For example,
    a convenience store carries fewer brands and fewer options on its shelves to increase
    shopper convenience. You park at the door of a smaller store, run in, grab your
    stuff, pay more than you would in a big-box bargain store, and off you go. Super
    convenient but at a price. Think of ChatGPT as a convenience store offering a
    one-stop shopping experience for the internet and apps.

    Its fast, unified responses are convenient compared to the process of thinking
    which keywords to use, entering them in a search bar, reading through the list
    the search engine produces, weeding out the ads, and finally selecting a source
    so you can read all that content and maybe find what you're seeking. If you don't
    find it, you must repeat the process. Compared to the ChatGPT experience, search
    is a lumbering, exhausting, and frustrating ordeal.

    No? Hmmm. Can you tell whether ChatGPT used a single source or several sources
    in generating its analysis? Hmmm. Do you see anything indicating whether the information
    ChatGPT gave you is current? Ah. You forgot about OpenAI’s warning that ChatGPT’s
    database is two years old, didn’t you? Uh-huh. We all do that sometimes.

    Can you see any information — sources, dates, cross-references, and other data
    or metadata qualifying ChatGPT’s response — in the machine’s narratives now that
    ChatGPT can be connected to the internet? No. That information is still not there.
  prefs:

    to its sources. Using ChatGPT information without these insights may be more convenient,
    but the price of the consequences may prove to be far more than you expected.
