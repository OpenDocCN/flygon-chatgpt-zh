- en: I embarked on writing this book in April 2023, pouring my thoughts onto the
    pages in a span of just under two months. It was an intense period during which
    I fully immersed myself in the world of ChatGPT, tirelessly experimenting with
    its capabilities and exploring its potential uses. My aim was to harness the power
    of this technology and shed light on its vast possibilities for business leaders.
    After only a few days of immersion, it was clear that SMBs had an unprecedented
    opportunity to leverage ChatGPT and level the playing field against their larger
    competitors.

- en: Initially, my intention for writing this book was to identify many of ChatGPT’s
    applications in the B2B world. However, as I delved further into this technology,
    I realized that it was not merely a tool for specific use cases—it was a complete
    game changer. I quickly realized how much capability it had to completely transform
    front-end operations and structures and why, without this transformation, firms
    would only realize a fraction of its total potential.

- en: What struck me the most throughout this process was how few business leaders,
    particularly those of us over the age of forty (i.e., most business leaders),
    truly grasped the profound impact and potential of ChatGPT. Conversations with
    individuals from my age group revealed a stark deficiency in their engagement
    with these transformative tools. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between
    age and willingness to embrace these new, emerging technologies. While the younger
    generation effortlessly embraced ChatGPT and its capabilities, many experienced
    leaders remained oblivious to its disruptive power.

    nature of ChatGPT without firsthand experience. The moment when individuals first
    interact with this tool can be awe-inspiring. It’s perhaps comparable to the profound
    shift in perspective that astronauts experience when they see Earth from space—a
    phenomenon known as the “overview effect.” With ChatGPT, I was captivated, fascinated,
    and at times even overwhelmed to the point of feeling physically nauseous. It
    was a clear sign that I was dealing with something profound and impactful.

- en: I primarily used ChatGPT, as it was clear (at least at the time) that it possessed
    far greater capabilities than other language models. I pushed ChatGPT’s boundaries,
    testing its capabilities across a wide array of tasks. I wanted to be sure I understood
    not only its capabilities, but also its limitations. Even for tasks that it failed,
    I couldn’t help but imagine how quickly these limitations could be resolved given
    the rapid pace of technological advancements. (And despite what others might tell
    you, these limitations will be addressed fast.) ChatGPT rarely disappointed me,
    and when it did, it was a signal for me to step back and regain perspective!

- en: My extensive use of ChatGPT allowed me to expand my expertise and proficiency
    with the tool. Yet, despite my growing familiarity, I found that using ChatGPT
    was still an unconventional and sometimes unnatural process for me. It required
    the development of new habits and ways of thinking. Ironically, even while writing
    a book focused on ChatGPT, I caught myself numerous times manually performing
    tasks that ChatGPT could easily accomplish. This experience made me realize the
    critical importance of change management in adopting ChatGPT within organizations.
    As business leaders, we must recognize that incorporating this technology is not
    just about acquiring a new tool; it necessitates a fundamental shift in mindset
    and behavior. We’ll need to push adoption but also maintain a sense of empathy
    and compassion.

- en: As I reflect on the content within this book, I acknowledge that my perspectives
    may evolve, and I may even find myself later laughing at some of my own thoughts,
    conclusions, or even the title for that matter. (Will *ChatGPT* still be the *Kleenex*
    of LLMs a year from this writing, or should I have titled the book differently?)
    It’s still very early in the game. However, I firmly believe that it is more important
    to put these ideas out into the public domain quickly, allowing them to take on
    a life of their own and subjecting them to criticism. While I may eventually form
    different opinions when it comes to the specifics of ChatGPT, I’m certain the
    ideas presented can offer utility or, at a minimum, provoke thought. I hope this
    book will challenge business leaders, urging them to recognize the urgent need
    to embrace and adopt these tools swiftly and decisively, and spark the deeper-level
    thinking required to truly understand the profound impacts that are ahead. Frankly,
    I find that true critical thinking is becoming disappointingly rare.

    in order to organize my ideas and express my ideas visually. I put pictures, diagrams,
    charts, etc. alongside written words. Visual aids really help me to understand,
    structure, and convey complex concepts, even if they’re eventually reduced to
    just words. Psychologists know that the utility of speaking and writing extends
    beyond the mere act of communication; these acts force the author to concretize
    abstract thoughts and crystallize ideas. I’ve found that writing for me, especially
    using pictures, serves as a powerful mechanism for enhancing both creativity and
    critical thinking. I wonder how this will evolve now that I have access to ChatGPT’s
    “easy button.” In general, as ChatGPT takes on more tasks, potentially doing more
    of the thinking, will we lose our chops?'

- en: Further along this direction of thought, ChatGPT’s emergence raises questions
    about the nature of creativity and intelligence and how it will evolve in the
    future. Today’s mainstream intellectuals now ponder matters like those previously
    reserved for science fiction, including the dangers of AI and whether ChatGPT
    possesses sentience or the ability to really think. Based on my own experiences
    as a writer, I can confidently say that ChatGPT does indeed think, albeit in a
    different manner than we do. We’ll likely need a new word to capture the true
    differences in the process. From using it, I don’t believe it possesses sentience,
    but I do believe that AI will continue to provide profound insights into our own
    nature and what truly drives us. In addition, these technologies might even shed
    more light on our deepest values as individuals and as a society.

    and later transcribed them using a speech-to-text app. The resulting text was
    often riddled with errors, omissions, and the frequent “um” or “ah.” I would then
    copy and paste this disorganized jumble of text into ChatGPT, just to witness
    its remarkable ability to make sense of it all. It was astounding to see how well
    ChatGPT could fill in the gaps and even offer novel ideas that sparked my creativity.
    In addition, reflecting on this writing process, I now realize that this book
    is somewhat akin to a diary, capturing my personal experiences and insights while
    working on it.

    enough to be uniquely positioned to share my insights. My diverse background in
    both traditional and digital businesses, combined with my end-to-end experience
    across all core business functions, provided me with the experience and strategic
    acumen that lent itself well to navigating the complexities of ChatGPT. Further
    appetite for learning and interest across diverse subjects—technology, psychology,
    economics, philosophy, and many others—enabled me to generate insights that I
    would not have otherwise realized. And my recent move into the consulting space
    afforded me the time and bandwidth to immerse myself, learn these tools and their
    capabilities, and think deeply about their impacts across B2B.

    oriented to topics like simple prompting and use cases, and any content published
    by the big consultants was so high level and general that SMBs would be hard-pressed
    to find any actionable conclusions or even figure out where to start. Nobody seemed
    to be admitting just how much digital-transformation playbooks had to change or
    how obsolete 2022’s books had become. Few if any guides existed that spoke to
    the true transformative potential of ChatGPT in companies nor prescribed any pragmatic
    steps to manifesting those possibilities. In that respect, I hope this book is
    different.

    consider myself a tech expert. I’ve been accused of being an old soul—by my wife
    nonetheless. I’m old-fashioned; I get the newspaper delivered and magazines by
    mail. I like old music and films. I read paper books. For heaven’s sake, I play
    golf. However, now over twenty years removed from college, the rapid advancement
    of technology has made me aware just how outdated many of my skill sets had become.
    The realization can be overwhelming when we acknowledge that many skills we have
    honed and developed over many years can now be replicated by computers. Yet, instead
    of succumbing to this feeling of obsolescence, I chose to embrace ChatGPT and
    all that it represents, and I encourage you to do the same. It is a tool that
    has the potential to empower us as business leaders and content creators. I hope
    that more business leaders will recognize that they too can easily become well
    versed in these new technologies, with some willingness and a little time investment.
    I can see few better uses of time given the stakes.

    and their impacts on their businesses, employees, markets, and customers. Now
    with ChatGPT, the post-COVID digital age poses a convergence of multiple generational
    disruptions, all grand in scale and all happening simultaneously. My intention
    for this book is to ignite a sense of urgency and drive, prodding leaders to adapt,

    the Eye of Providence at the top of the pyramid—the symbol on the back of our
    one-dollar bill—maintaining constant awareness of the business and all the factors
    affecting its path forward. Immerse yourself in these new technologies to understand
    their impacts, and apply the foresight needed to guide your business through this
    once-in-several-generation phenomenon. It’s a journey into the unknown, where
    old paradigms give way to new possibilities and where the intersection of human
    and machine intelligence holds the key to unlocking unprecedented growth and success.
