- en: Step 1 - Find a local market segment you’d like to target. Get ChatGPT to help
    you with that using its awesome research capabilities. ChatGPT will come up with
    a list such as hair salons, coffee shops, restaurants, pet shops, gyms, florists,
    law offices, dance schools, accountants, interior design firms, and more. Once
    you’ve decided on one or more categories, go ahead and move on to step 2.

    email services” targeting your specific market segment. Have ChatGPT write 3 versions
    of this email that you can run A/B tests with.

    At first you want to rotate through the three original templates that ChatGPT
    created for you, but once you start seeing results, double down on the template
    that’s giving you the best results. Make sure you customize the email template
    each time you send one out. Tailor it fo the specific industry, the specific business,
    maybe even include samples of emails you could be writing for them. This will
    take time, but will be WELL worth the effort!

- en: Step 5 - Ask ChatGPT to help you come up with a list of questions to ask your
    prospective clients. For example, you can say “I offer email marketing to local
    florists. Help me come up with a list of questions to ask a new client to learn
    about their business.”

    free), plug in all those questions to create a new onboarding form for new clients.
    Now you’ll send all the potential clients who respond to your sales email to this
    form so you can “assess their needs and give them a quote.” By having leads complete
    this type of form, it gets them invested in the process which makes them more
    likely to hire you.

- en: Step 7 - Send a quote to all those who have filled out the form. Ask ChatGPT
    to write an email pitching your services. For example, you could say “write an
    email sharing a quote for email marketing services with a local florist called
    “Florista.” The quote is for $100/email, 8 emails/months, total $800/month.”
