    and personalized instruction to each student can be a time-consuming task. ChatGPT
    can help alleviate this burden by providing quality feedback and instruction resources,
    allowing you to focus on adding your personal touch to the instruction. In this
    chapter, we will explore ways to employ ChatGPT as a teaching assistant, including
    essay grading, reading comprehension, creating Madlib stories, generating writing
    prompts, preparing writing samples, writing instructions for various tasks, creating
    personalized study plans, creating a presentation outline and generating dummy
    data. Let’s dive in and see how ChatGPT can help you save time and provide more
    personalized instruction to your students.
