    stark departure from the tranquil wilderness of Montana. The chaos of Billings
    Logan International Airport was in full throttle. Jets streaked across the sprawling

    her late twenties, exuding an air of sophistication that marked her an outsider.
    Her attire, immaculate and classy, whispered of New York high fashion. But it
