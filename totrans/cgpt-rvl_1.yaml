- en: It isn't a hefty tome that you'll have trouble carrying around, or that you'll
    leave on your bedside table to gather coffee-cup stains. Rather, it offers quick
    tips, real-life stories, lots of no-nonsense advice, questions to encourage you
    to reflect on how you're working now and how you could use ChatGPT to work simpler
    and smarter, and practical exercises to help you get started.

- en: My suggestion for working through this book is to keep it simple and achievable.
    Start small and work your way up to the bigger concepts. Read the book and choose
    one or two things that resonate strongly with you and start to action those immediately.
    (You will thank me when you see how simple it really is.)

    friend, Roger Deaner, who told me to ‘believe nothing, and test or try everything’.
    This has helped me maintain my curiosity in the face of negativity, blowhardedness
    (I don't know if that's even a word!), and 'splaining.

    I say in this book. Instead, I want you to get curious about ChatGPT and explore
    it for yourself. This will provide you with a hands-on experience of its capabilities
    and limitations and allow you to explore its potential applications.

    and work are way too important to be taken too seriously. And reading a book should
    be a pleasure, not a pain!
