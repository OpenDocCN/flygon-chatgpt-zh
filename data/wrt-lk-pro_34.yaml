- en: The AIDA model is a classic framework that is used to structure copywriting
    and advertising messages. It focuses on capturing the reader’s attention, arousing
    their interest, creating a desire for the product or service being offered, and
    finally inciting them to take action. This framework is best used for direct-response
    advertisements or sales pages. The AIDA framework is one of the oldest and most
    widely recognized copywriting frameworks. It dates back to the late 1800s and
    was first used by advertising pioneer Claude Hopkins.

    and roasted to perfection, guaranteed to give you that rich, bold flavor you’ve
