- en: ChatGPT prompts work by inputting a prompt or seed text into the language model,
    which then generates text as an output. The generated text is based on the vast
    knowledge base that the model has been trained on, as well as the patterns and
    relationships it has learned between words and phrases. This guide will teach
    you how to effectively structure your prompts in order to create exceptional content,
    whether itâ€™s for your clients or for your own purposes.
