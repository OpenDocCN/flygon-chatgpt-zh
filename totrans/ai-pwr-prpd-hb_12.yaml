    can contribute to reduced fuel consumption. He considers whether a single component
    is sufficient, or if a combination of components would be more effective in achieving
    the desired outcome. Additionally, he considers the costs associated with producing
    the widget and evaluates its potential market demand. Ahmed consults with colleagues
    and industry experts to obtain feedback on the design and its potential impact.
    During this process, he discovers that the selected polymer material remains expensive
    to produce at scale, but he identifies an alternative manufacturing process that
    can help to reduce costs.
