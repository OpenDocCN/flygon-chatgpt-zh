    you have on hand. Maybe you have some quinoa and canned black beans lying around — ChatGPT
    can suggest meal ideas like a quinoa and black bean bowl, a vegetarian chili,
    or a black bean and quinoa salad. This is particularly useful if you have leftovers.
    It not only helps you avoid wasting food, but it can also save you money on groceries.

    simply ask ChatGPT to suggest meal ideas that take 30 minutes or fewer to prepare.
