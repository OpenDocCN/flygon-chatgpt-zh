    looking for ideas on how to use chatGPT in your classroom. In that case, I hope
    it inspired you to propel your class forward. Or you may be looking for ways to
    shield students from artificial intelligence. But I hope that is not the case.
    Artificial intelligence is here to stay. Over the years, you will see its use
    increase in importance and frequency. We should take advantage of AI to make the
    world better. Computers are a force multiplier that can help us do work quickly
    so we can focus our attention on more pressing issues.

- en: Throughout history, some educators have bristled at the introduction of new
    technologies and their impact on teaching and learning. For example, Plato spoke
    of the effect of writing in *Phaedrus*, “Enough of the art of speaking; let us
    now proceed to consider the true use of writing. There is an old Egyptian tale
    of Theuth, the inventor of writing, showing his invention to the god Thamus, who
    told him that he would only spoil men’s memories and take away their understandings.”
    Likewise, there has been criticism and angst over each new technology and its
    impact on education. Search, and you will find complaints regarding the introduction
    of computers, the internet, the digitization of libraries, etc. Artificial intelligence
    will change teaching and learning, as have all the previous technologies. However,
    our role as educators is to prepare students for the future.

- en: Please give chatGPT a test drive. I am confident you will be fascinated with
    what you discover. However, remember that it is an emerging technology that has
    not yet been perfected. Each iteration will become better. Also, note that chatGPT
    is free as I write this book, but that may not always be the case.
