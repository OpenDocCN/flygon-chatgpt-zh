- en: When ChatGPT was introduced, students immediately began using it to do their
    homework. However, many chose to use it not to help with their homework but to
    do it for them. Educators were not amused. A kerfuffle followed as educators and
    parents fretted that ChatGPT was an instrument for cheating and would rob students
    of their ability to hone critical thinking skills. The worriers were only partly
    right.

- en: Cheaters are going to cheat, and teachers have to catch them if they can. This
    task is not easy because ChatGPT generates text that is difficult to distinguish
    from human writing. However, educators are adept at catching cheaters. For decades
    they’ve confiscated crib notes, barred calculator use in classes and tests, busted
    test ringers, checked dutifully for plagiarism, and generally outed the ne’er-do-wells
    and the ethically impaired. So, really, ChatGPT brings nothing new to this front.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And catching cheaters who use ChatGPT may be easier than catching those who
    use more traditional tools. For example, you can’t catch a cheater who used a
    calculator unless you see the device because you can’t prove a student did wrong
    by the mere presence of a right answer.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT, on the other hand, delivers plenty of wrong answers that can help educators
    snare wrongdoers. Plus, ChatGPT can be so convincing with its hallucinations that
    students won’t catch on that the answer it gave is incorrect unless they know
    the correct answer already or look it up to check. It’s almost a comical case
    of cheating gone wrong as learning happens anyway.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT also tends to favor and endlessly repeat phrases in its answers. This
    behavior makes finding cheaters easier because software and professors can look
    for repetitious phrases in an individual student’s assignment and across the homework
    of many students.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At some point, educators will be able to simply ask an AI model who cheated
    on a test or an assignment, and it will either confess or point out the evidence.
    Imagine using a scanner or phone camera to feed into an AI model several classes'
    worth of assignments. Within minutes, the AI model would grade the assignments,
    find what each student struggled with in the assignment, offer personalized suggestions,
    and collar the cheaters too!

    that will get sorted in due time. Instead, this chapter is about how educators
    can use ChatGPT to better serve their students by offering more personalized support
    and instruction.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    critical thinking skills. This problem can be prevented by flipping the teaching
    model.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, students are taught information and then quizzed. With ChatGPT, the
    student must ask the right question to unlock the information, an approach that's
    the reverse of how critical thinking is traditionally taught and tested.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT’s outputs are only as good as the inputs a human gives it. For students
    to prompt the AI to deliver the answers they seek, they’ll need to think carefully
    and critically about how to word their query or command first. Teaching students
    how to think about and write prompts is an effective way to help them develop
    critical thinking skills.

- en: Prompting is so essential to leveraging ChatGPT and other AI models that prompt
    engineering is a critical skill in the AI field. Teaching students critical thinking
    skills to use in crafting prompts will ensure that they have a necessary job skill
    and a bright employment future. Companies will pay big bucks for talented prompt
    engineers — at least for a while. Eventually, AI models will get better at guessing
    a user’s intention, even if the quality of their prompt is poor. AutoGPT, another
    emerging AI model, is already capable of making its own prompts from a user’s
    mere suggestion. This improvement will go a long way in making the benefits of
    AI accessible to everyone, but it won’t eliminate the need for creative and critical
    thinking. In this Age of AI, those who can wield these tools well will prosper,
    which makes critical thinking skills and prompt engineering excellent job skills
    for educators to teach — and for educators to learn.

- en: Leveraging ChatGPT to Aid Overworked Educators
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Educators are notoriously overworked and underappreciated. ChatGPT can help
    alleviate at least some of the strain. For example, it can be used to grade assignments
    and to do so with deeper analysis than educators have time to do. ChatGPT can
    deliver scores as well as suggestions on where each student is struggling and
    how the educator can help them in a personalized teaching or mentoring plan.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And ChatGPT can do all this in minutes. Homework, test, and project scores can
    be computed instantly when students turn them in, or educators and assistants
    can use AI to score the entire class before the educator heads home at the end
    of the workday.
  prefs:

- en: ChatGPT can also be useful in quickly developing or adapting lesson plans and
    completing other work that educators need to do, from ordering supplies to completing
    tasks required by administrators. [Figure 7-3](#filepos285983) is an example of
    how ChatGPT can write lesson plans. Its response was pasted into a Word document
    to show more of its response here. Responses can be quite lengthy and detailed,
    but educators can prompt ChatGPT to condense responses if desired.

  prefs:

- en: One example is the Speak plug-in for ChatGPT, which is shown in [Figure 7-4](#filepos287300).
    The prompt asks ChatGPT to evaluate a student’s attempt at translating a question
    from English to Spanish and to show additional responses in the three most common
    Spanish dialects. Note that the AI understood the task even with the typo in the
    prompt.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT could have attempted this task on its own and would have likely succeeded,
    but its response is far more accurate with the Speak plug-in. Speak is a specialized
    foreign-language translation tool whereas ChatGPT is a general language tool,
    albeit one that can converse in several natural human languages.

    down arrow to the right of Plugins at the top right of the ChatGPT user interface,

    the appropriate one for any given task. By installing the plug-ins you think you’ll
    need for the project at hand, you'll get better results from your prompts.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Plugins Alpha selection under the Models menu is an early version of a ChatGPT
    model that will automatically find, install, and use plug-ins as ChatGPT needs
    them to answer your prompt. Don’t panic if you go to ChatGPT and don’t see a way
    to get to the Plugin Store. In probably means that ChatGPT no longer needs you
    to do that manually.

    into Duolingo Max instead of the other way around, like the Speak plug-in.

    and easier to use. Eventually, AI will become an educator’s superapp, meaning
    a single entity capable of helping educators and students with almost anything.
