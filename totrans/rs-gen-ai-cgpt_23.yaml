    with math. It analyses vast amounts of text from many websites and builds a model
    of the words that are most likely to come after one another in a phrase. This
    version of autocomplete is more advanced.

    lack human-level insight or creativity. Also, ChatGPT is unable to take the role
    of a real-life math teacher or tutor who can provide individualised explanations
    and comments. There may also be certain specialised or challenging mathematical
    issues that ChatGPT is not educated in, but ChatGPT is always studying and expanding
    my body of knowledge.

    its grandeur in its current form. Even though GPT-3.5, the language model on which
    ChatGPT is based, is in its third iteration, more work has to be done. GPT-4,
    scheduled for release in late 2023, is anticipated to improve on GPT-3.5’s drawbacks
    through improved performance and greater adherence to human instructions and values.
