- en: Identify the purpose and focus of the conversation. Before writing your prompt,
    it's essential to have a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve through
    the conversation. Do you want to provide information, answer a question, or engage
    in casual conversation? By identifying the purpose and focus of the conversation,
    you can craft a prompt that is specific and relevant, leading to a more engaging
    and informative conversation with ChatGPT.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use specific and relevant language. To make sure that ChatGPT understands your
    prompt and can provide an appropriate response, it's crucial to use specific and
    relevant language. Avoid using jargon or ambiguous language that may cause confusion
    or misunderstandings. Instead, strive to be as clear and concise as possible,
    using language that is relevant to the topic at hand.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Avoid using open-ended or overly broad prompts. While it may be tempting to
    ask open-ended or overly broad questions in an attempt to get a more comprehensive
    response, these types of prompts can often result in disjointed or unfocused conversations
    with ChatGPT. Instead, aim to be as specific as possible in your prompts, defining
    a clear purpose and focus for the conversation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Review and revise your prompt. Before sending your prompt to the ChatGPT, take
    a moment to review and revise it to ensure that it is clear and easy to understand.
    Consider whether the language is specific and relevant, and whether the prompt
    is focused and avoids ambiguity.
