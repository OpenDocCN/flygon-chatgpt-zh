    defects in output, including “hallucinations” which produce seemingly credible
    answers that are in fact false. In addition, while ChatGPT’s capabilities are
    mesmerizing in many ways, it’s surprisingly terrible at simple math, and calculations
    are prone to error. Businesses can find ways around these issues to utilize its
    immense capabilities, and count on these issues being rapidly resolved—likely
    in the next twelve to twenty-four months—using methods like multisource validation
    and implementing improved calculation protocols. As truth and calculation reliability
    improve, ChatGPT will have the power to largely replace many sales, operational,
    financial, and other tasks across the enterprise. In the meantime, don’t allow
    these real limitations to obfuscate the immense utility these tools can currently
    provide.

    virtually endless, certain functions offer greater potential for utility. Public
    variants might be most beneficial to functions like customer relationship management
    (CRM, i.e., sales and marketing) and customer service, both of whose day-to-day
    tasks tend to (1) be more communication-centric, (2) use more generalized skills
    and knowledge, and (3) involve more nonrepeating and creative efforts versus habitual,
    repetitive tasks. CRM in particular will present the biggest initial opportunities
    for adoption as compared to highly specialized, less communication-centric and/or
    more repetitive functions like supply chain management (SCM) or product lifecycle
    management (PLM).

    Sales teams often face challenges in dedicating sufficient time and effort to
    develop new business opportunities. However, with the emergence of ChatGPT, salespeople
    now have the power to streamline their prospecting efforts and boost new customer
    acquisition. By leveraging ChatGPT’s capabilities, sales teams can create, execute,
    and monitor prospecting activities with remarkable efficiency gains. This technology
    has the potential to reduce work time by 90 percent or more, allowing salespeople
    to allocate their valuable time to other important tasks and initiatives. The
    advent of ChatGPT truly empowers sales teams to accelerate their growth and achieve
    greater success in acquiring new customers.

    input, ChatGPT generates a preliminary prospecting email, which can be refined
    further.'

    it focuses on specific portfolio elements, value drivers, or any other relevant
    aspects. By orienting the email to the goals of a particular company or industry
    segment, the messaging becomes more personalized and impactful. To cater to different
    company types or buyer personas, salespeople can create several core-message variants
    or even uniquely customize each and every message, leveraging the versatility

- en: The expanded list of applications on the preceding page was a long one, but
    even our mere three example use cases add up to some serious efficiencies. It
    is not uncommon for firms to discover that—at least theoretically via value-stream
    mapping and end-to-end analysis—they can reduce SG&A expenses by 50 percent or
    more by applying ChatGPT to replace tasks and traditional ways of performing many
    activities.

- en: ChatGPT adoption offers efficiency and innovation impacts that are orders of
    magnitude beyond other more popular investments (e.g., CRM software, which certainly
    carries a significant initial investment and annual costs). Why then are firms
    so willing to invest in things like expensive software but less willing to make
    equal investments in realizing the enormous impacts of the widespread adoption
    of ChatGPT? How long will it take conventional wisdom to catch up, and how many
    lemmings will plunge off the cliff in the meantime? The financial impacts can
    be enormous, providing another strong signal that the rules of the game have completely
    changed.

- en: Most six-month-old playbooks for new-customer acquisition would have previously
    prescribed mass-market techniques like marketing automation or lead-gen campaigns,
    both often outsourced and both using technology to “pull,” nurture, and qualify
    new leads. These playbooks would also recommend CRM systems for structuring data,
    engaging customers, running analytics, creating management reports, and a long
    list of other promised benefits. However, the value propositions for these tools
    inherently include liabilities beyond financial costs. For example, a CRM system
    might provide strong utility in some areas, but it can be harmful to sales cultures,
    often turning salespeople into data clerks and imposing big-company-style non-value-add
    work. Marketing automation has difficulties in breaking through the “shields”
    that digital has created to defend customers from advertiser saturation (which,
    ironically, digital created in the first place).

- en: With ChatGPT now making salespeople hyperproductive and tools like Excel exponentially
    more powerful, old assumptions need to be updated. Smart firms who realize that
    the game has changed can redesign their own machines and tune them to new immense
    gains in capabilities. For example, firms can build a set of direct push processes
    that rivals much more expensive methods, services, and software for a small fraction
    of the cost, while better engaging front-end personnel and overcoming many of
    the inherent roadblocks associated with modern sales and marketing. (We’ll review
    some of these ideas later.) ChatGPT has now made every one of your salespeople
    immensely more powerful without the need for that additional software, and it’s
    unlocked marketing capabilities previously unavailable to SMBs. With an innovative
    mindset and a little investment in adopting these tools, smart firms can take
    advantage if they’re willing to think a little differently.

    manufacturing, or product development? How might a “system” of these machines—i.e.,
    a business in total—operate better with some strategic changes made to the system
    design? Leaders must think beyond mere adoption and realize that end-to-end organizational
    processes, playbooks, and expectations need to be redesigned and rebooted for
    a new age of capabilities and productivity.
