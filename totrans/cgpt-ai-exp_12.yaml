    for this book. My hope is that readers will find this a useful guide to using
    ChatGPT to generate content of their own, and that it will simultaneously elucidate
    some of the capabilities and limitations of the ChatGPT technology. So here’s
    a travelog of my chats with ChatGPT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is exceptionally polite and writes very
    clean, grammatically correct prose. I have to admit that I found this extremely
    refreshing relative to almost all other content on the Internet. I would even
    encourage my elderly parents to interact with it because they would find it friendly,
    knowledgeable, and courteous.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ll begin with a note about the cover art for the book and the illustrations,
    all of which were generated using AI text-to-image generation systems. I used
    NightCafe.com with the Stable Diffusion algorithm to generate each of the illustrations.
    In each case, I began by feeding text copied directly from the manuscript into
    the algorithm prompt to generate a set of four trial images. I then used my human
    sensibilities to decide which image to use at each point in the book, and in some
    cases even chose to use all four of the generated images because the vignette
    of four images was interesting in its own right. For many of the illustrations,
    this approach didn’t work because text-to-image generation systems are not always
    great at creating an image that depicts a concept rather than a physical object.
    As a result, for some of the images, I intervened and asked for a specific object
    or representation to illustrate some part of each chapter.

    humans generated in the process are creepy. It was better to ask for “cuneiform
    tablets” than for “people gathered around cuneiform tablets.” I also noted that
    the tablets thus represented tended to contain blocks or squiggles that were reminiscent
    of cuneiform, rather than actually containing any cuneiform.'

    (and I believe this is true of most of the text-to-image systems right now), they
    were generally Caucasian, with males being represented in a variety of ages, but
    females generally looking like 20-somethings. This is not a criticism of the algorithms:
    They are a representation of the information that is presented on the Internet,
    not a representation of how we would like the world to be. I did not experiment
    much with generating people of different ethnicities, genders and ages since they
    were mostly pretty creepy anyway. As a matter of image-generating utility, it
    is likely that better control over what people look like and what demographics
    they represent will be developed in text-to-image tools in the near future. To
    be fair, the image of Tom and Emily that I chose from my four candidates in Chapter
    7 did naturally represent Emily as non-white, so the algorithms are not completely
    ignorant of the composition of the world’s population.'

    Master Wordsmith, seems a bit “Lord-of-the-Rings-ish.” That is because, for the
    sake of exploring the writing style range of ChatGPT, I asked ChatGPT to write
    the story in the style of JRR Tolkein. I did the same with the image generation
    process, resulting in some hilariously Hobbit-like depictions of Arwen. The image
    I chose has some very interesting characteristics. For example, Arwen’s hair is
    a mixture between a hood and long hair, a neat trick of shape, texture and shading
    pulled off by Stable Diffusion.

    to expand on the first bullet point from its original summary of the book. I am
    also asking for 2000 words, thinking this is a decent size for a single, short-ish
    book chapter. It’s not clear to me that ChatGPT was at all impacted by my request
    for 2000 words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The second thing to note is that I have given up on writing “like Bob Rogers,
    PhD” and have requested instead for ChatGPT to write in a “flowery, literary style
    with examples and anecdotes.” I found that the “flowery, literary style” resulted
    in ChatGPT generating more verbose output, and using more descriptive terms. This
    may have been my imagination, since we humans are easily victimized by the power
    of suggestion. The first chapter begins with “In the beginning, there was only
    the voice, the sound of human breath and tongue forming words, sharing stories
    and experiences,” which does sound flowery and literary to me. I wondered if I
    was second-order plagiarizing someone else through ChatGPT, so I searched parts
    of this sentence on the Internet. No solid hits came up, so I imagine that ChatGPT
    is generating new text by randomly selecting from aggregated statistical patterns
    and not just memorizing specific phrases. (This is consistent with how Transformer
    AI models, the technology behind ChatGPT, work in general: They don’t memorize
    specific phrases so much as associate probabilities of words following other words,
    based on very complex and nuanced patterns.)'

    the hood of ChatGPT, that controls how far afield the generated language is allowed
    to flow in creating a response. Presumably, increasing Temperature in the settings
    might allow a broader “creativity” in the writing of ChatGPT. That experiment
    is left to the reader.

    This resulted in ChatGPT citing a number of very interesting examples as part
    of its output. These examples tended to be quite informative and interesting to
    me, so I imagine that they improve the overall value of the book.

    with this version of Chapter 1 was that it was still quite short and felt more
    like a detailed summary of a chapter, rather than the chapter itself. In order
    to follow my goal that ChatGPT should write the whole book, I had a problem. I
    wanted to ask detailed questions and push ChatGPT to get into detail about things
    I thought were important to each topic, but that would have broken my standard.
    The solution was to take each paragraph in the first version of the chapter and
    ask for more details about it.

    incorporating much of my own human knowledge about AI into the process.

    impaired, nor any interesting anecdotes about Helen Keller or Pedro Ponce de León,
    a 16th-century Spanish Benedictine monk who is credited on the Internet as one
    of the first to apply a formal sign language for communication by hearing impaired.
    I chose not to ask ChatGPT specifically about this, because it was my intent to
    have ChatGPT generate all of the content for the main part of the book. Adding
    my own questions would have been cheating, or at least constitute a different

    who created a set of written characters to represent the syllables of the spoken
    Cherokee language. This resulted in literacy among a high percentage of the Cherokee
    people, and a methodology to record the Cherokee language and some of its history
    and storytelling.

- en: Another interesting communication anecdote missing from ChatGPT’s narrative
    is the entire topic of encryption and secure communication. Historical examples
    like the use of Navajo code talkers in WWII, who encrypted their own native language
    to enable quick, encoded communication during the war would have made an interesting
    addition. Security and encrypted communication are also critical in the era of
    the Internet, given that no communication on the Internet is protected from prying
    eyes unless it is properly encrypted. This could have become an even more interesting
    topic in a book about communication and the impact of computing (AI) on its evolution
    since one of the biggest technical risks we face right now is the likelihood that
    quantum computing will someday make our current encryption methods (the most common
    of which is an algorithm called AES-256 encryption) obsolete. It turns out that
    a sufficiently powerful quantum algorithm can break AES-256 encryption within
    a reasonable amount of time. While some security alarmists are already saying
    that rogue nations have working quantum computers, I recently spoke to a quantum
    computing graduate student who thinks a “real” quantum computer of that scale
    is probably a decade off. This could have been an interesting point for ChatGPT
    to bring up, but it did not pick up the encryption thread in the story.

- en: Finally, an interesting note about a topic that ChatGPT did not forget, and
    which in fact it seems to adore, is the invention of the printing press. Every
    time I asked about historical development of communication or creativity, regardless
    of what the context was, ChatGPT enthusiastically brought the conversation around
    to the development of the printing press. Of course, this is proper, since the
    invention of the printing press was a game changer for human communication, and
    probably a door-opener for broader communication and creativity among more average
    humans, but I suspect that it is reflecting that as a secondary effect of the
    fact that many documents have been written that mention the development of the
    printing press, and from a statistical point of view, ChatGPT is impressed by
    this. Parenthetically, I do hope ChatGPT is not too impressed with all the commentary
    of social media about various political figures in our current world. I would
    hate to think that future students will learn more about current shenanigans than
    about real historically important figures.

    and a love story. You can judge for yourself how well it did. I personally found
    it interesting and compelling that ChatGPT always tried to conclude with a theme
    that was uplifting for the poor humans who were demoralized by its awesomeness.
    I imagine that that is the result of specific training by OpenAI Foundation during
    the chatbot training phase of ChatGPT.

    as a chatbot was trained in a second, human moderated phase to ensure that it
    could not be easily asked to do bad things. For example, if you ask it how to
    build a bomb, it will politely demure. I suspect that the politeness of ChatGPT,
    and its desire to defer to the ultimate grandeur of human creativity, are also
    direct results of ChatGPT’s reinforcement learning “niceness” training.

    idea for a business. They spent hours brainstorming, but no matter how hard they
    tried, they just couldn’t think of anything.

    see what ideas were already out there. They went to a website that listed hundreds
    of different business ideas, and after a few minutes of scrolling, they found
    one that they all agreed was perfect.

    as they were discussing the details, one of the friends suddenly realized something:
    “Wait a minute, this is the exact same idea that we came up with last year! We
    just forgot about it because we never wrote it down.”'

    up with a creative idea, only to find out that they had already had one and simply
    forgotten about it. They all agreed that the internet had definitely changed the
    way they approached creativity and problem solving.'
