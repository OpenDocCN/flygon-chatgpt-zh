- en: 'How to write a book with ChatGPT in 24 hoursWhat? Weren’t we done? Have I gotten
    the chapters mixed up?In the words of the  Chapulín Colorado[6](part0036.xhtml):
    “Calm down! Nobody panic!”. It’s all under control. Everything is where it’s meant
    to be.This book has been one of those experiments you know I love to do. I don’t
    like to simply tell you things or limit myself to giving you my opinion or summarizing
    things you could easily find with a quick Google search.Because everything you
    have read so far was written by ChatGPT.Did you wonder what the date and time
    at the beginning of the book and this chapter were all about?I wonder if you’re
    starting to join the dots.They are, in fact, the day and time that I started writing
    this book and when I finished it, just as I had decided to do one day earlier.
    Let me explain.For weeks, I had been reading and listening to many self-publishing
    experts tell their followers that ChatGPT was okay, but that they had nothing
    to fear; it posed no threat to writers.How’s that? It may not be a threat to every
    writer, but of course, for many it will be. Especially for those who rest on their
    laurels and don’t move with the times.Instead of getting into a debate and trying
    to refute their arguments on social media, I had the idea of creating this book…and
    proving it.Having spent all day with this idea swirling in my head, on the evening
    of April 24th, when I was already in bed about to sleep, I turned toward my girlfriend,
    Maia, and said: “Tomorrow I’ll wake up when you do.”The next day, Maia would be
    getting ready to go to work at 6am and she wouldn’t be home until late. So I decided
    to get up at the same time as her and have a book written – and published! – before
    she got home at 10pm, using ChatGPT.The book you hold in your hands is the result
    of that experiment.Can you think of a better way to demonstrate the potential
    of ChatGPT and the importance of not getting left behind?Since you have reached
    this point in the book, I’m guessing you found that at the very least acceptable
    (that was the goal), so I’m going to explain to you exactly how I did it, step
    by step, so that you too can write, publish and sell (yes, sell!) a book in under
    twenty-four hours. Let’s go.The process is so simple, and it’s almost the same
    as the one I follow with all my other books – except that on this occasion, it
    was ChatGPT who was going to follow each of my 10 steps to publishing a book:'

    for which the research process lasted several years, this time it took me just
    fifteen minutes.Given that the topic of my book was already clear (otherwise,
    I could have asked ChatGPT for ideas), the first thing I had to do was study the
    market and get to know my target customer or potential reader.To do this, all
    I had to do was ask ChatGPT to prepare a list of thirty problems or pains of a
    person interested in writing a book using AI, and out of these, I chose the fifteen
    I found most powerful and pertinent to my book. That’s it.Could I have gone into
    more depth? Without a doubt, much more. But for the objective of this book, I
    had more than enough.Remember that the success of a non-fiction book lies in its
    capacity to deliver on its promise: to resolve the reader’s problem or alleviate
    their pain. And with this simple research, I had ten problems I knew ChatGPT could
    solve. Except, of course, for teaching how to write a book with AI in twenty-four
    hours.Bear in mind that, without ChatGPT, the minimum research I recommend doing
    is reading the three top-selling books on the topic you want to write about, so
    we just saved a few days or weeks of intensive reading.Description (15 min.)![](image_rsrcXR.jpg)Based
    on this selection of fifteen problems I wanted this book to solve, I asked ChatGPT
    to create a 350-word description in AIDA format.All I had to add to the result
    I got was the list of problems in the format of: “This book is for you if…”, three
    questions as a header, and one final call to action, which I also asked ChatGPT
    to provide.In this way, in under fifteen minutes, I obtained a written description
    in perfect persuasive language, able to grab the interest of my potential reader
    and using the same format of the rest of my books. Not bad.Title (15 min.)![](image_rsrcXS.jpg)Getting
    a list of ideas for the title and subtitle of your book is as easy as asking ChatGPT
    nicely, and it will immediately present you with as many options and variations
    as you need until you find a combination you like.But don’t let the speed and
    simplicity of the process detract from its importance, as the success of a book
    begins with its title. Remember the Formula for a Perfect Title[7](part0037.xhtml):FPT
    = key words (SEO) + solution (sore point) + personality + time limit.Bearing all
    this in mind, after obtaining the first few results, all I had to do was ask it
    to give me a new list, this time accounting for SEO.With this simple prompt, I
    found the title that brought you to this book, and – with the possible exception
    of personality – it ticks all the boxes of the formula for a perfect title.Cover
    (1 hour)![](image_rsrcXT.jpg)Once I had chosen a title, I asked ChatGPT to give
    me a list of ideas for my book cover along with a prompt optimized for DALL-E[8](part0038.xhtml).Then,
    I copied these prompts and pasted them into two of the image generators I had
    been experimenting with in the days leading up: DALL-E and Bing Image Creator.The
    result I liked best was one generated by Bing Image Creator. With this design,
    I went to Photoshop (you can use Canva if you prefer) and added the title, subtitle
    and author.Considering that the next best option (quality-price) that I recommend
    is to run a contest on the platform [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/),
    which costs approximately fifty dollars and lasts seven days, we just saved some
    money and a lot of waiting time that could have been spent selling our book. Because
    once you have your cover ready...You can put your book on sale!Publication 1/2
    (15 min.)It wasn’t even 9am yet and I had published my book!Because with Amazon
    KDP, to start selling your book, up to a year before launch date, all you need
    is: a title, a description and a cover. Something we have achieved in under three
    hours.What are the advantages of putting a book on presale?'

    the main reason (not the only one) why I decided to put this book on presale.
    Because once it’s up, there’s no going back.It didn’t matter if something more
    important had come up, if things got difficult, or if I changed my mind…once it
    was on presale, I wasn’t going to let Amazon penalize me under any circumstances.Contents
    (15 min.)![](image_rsrcXU.jpg)Based on the description, I asked ChatGPT to create
    the contents for a 10,000-word book.Why 10,000? Because it’s been shown that non-fiction
    books of ten to fifteen thousand words each (also known as “short reads”) are
    well-received and work very well.Careful! For the moment, ChatGPT is not very
    good with numbers. Add to that the fact that, also for the moment, it has a limitation
    in its answers of around five hundred words, you may end up frustrated trying
    to get the length you want for your book. I learned the hard way.Pro tip: instead
    of asking ChatGPT to prepare the contents for a book of X number of words, ask
    it for the contents for a book of X number of chapters or subsections. How many?
    It’s easy. All you have to do is divide the number of words you want for your
    book by five hundred (the maximum answer length).For example, if you want ChatGPT
    to write a 10,000-word book, the contents should have a total of twenty chapters
    or subsections:10,000/500 = 20Taking this into account, for the 10,000-word book,
    you could ask it for various combinations:A 20-chapter book with no subsections.'

    best for your book.Writing the book (1 hour)![](image_rsrcXV.jpg)When it was time
    to write the book, all I had to do was ask ChatGPT to develop it chapter by chapter,
    starting at the beginning. So, without leaving the chat where I had created the
    contents, I prompted it: “Please develop the introduction”.And so on and so forth.If
    I liked how the chapter came out, great. If not, I just had to ask it to rewrite
    it with some additional indications, or simply click “Regenerate response”, and
    I would get a new version without needing to do anything at all. In addition,
    I could click this button unlimited times and review all the versions that had
    been generated in order to compare them and pick my favorite.You know that, other
    than asking it to lengthen the chapter if it’s already at its 500-word limit,
    you can ask it for whatever you want: “summarize it in X words”, “give me an example”,
    “number the key points as a conclusion”, “find studies that back up this information”,
    and so on.By repeating this process for each chapter, I had finished my book in
    a matter of minutes.Pro tip: If you want ChatGPT to use your style or that of
    your favorite author when it’s writing, now is the time to tell it. To do this,
    just paste a representative extract with the style you want to replicate and ask
    ChatGPT to analyze it. You know: tone, rhythm and vocabulary.If the analysis says,
    for example, that the text is written in a conversational, direct and motivational
    fashion, when you ask ChatGPT to write each of your chapters, don’t forget to
    tell it you want that style.That’s what I did when I reached this point. I pasted
    a fragment from one of my books, asked ChatGPT to analyze it, and then asked it
    to write each chapter emulating that style.Do you think it worked?For my tastes,
    I think it was a little too heavy on the jokes. Or maybe it’s that when I didn’t
    write them, they’re just not as funny. Now that I think about it…that would explain
    why almost all the negative reviews on my books focus on me and not the content.
    Oops!Editing (5 hours)Although the result I got was already really good (I consider
    that ChatGPT writes much better than I do), I spent most of the day editing the
    book, for two reasons:First, to verify that everything it said was true and that
    there were no mistakes. You know that, as authors, we are the only ones responsible
    for what we publish, even if it was written by ChatGPT.And second, to pass the
    test of any artificial intelligence detectors[9](part0039.xhtml). Why? Isn’t it
    enough to be transparent with your readers about using it? Ethically, yes. But
    as Amazon still hasn’t made a statement about AI (which Google has, in favor of
    it, of course), for the time being it’s worth being careful.So, before uploading
    your book to KDP or any other platform, make sure you know the platform’s policy
    on the use of artificial intelligence. And if, like Amazon, they haven’t made
    their stance clear yet, it’s better for your book to pass the AI detector test
    without arousing suspicion.Layout (1 hour)I’m sure you know from my other books
    that what you say (the content) is as important as how you present it (the layout).A
    good layout will help your book not just to be good, but to look good.So, since
    it was time to roll up my sleeves, I made this process as easy as possible by
    using a layout template.Using a good template can reduce the time you spend on
    a book’s layout from several days to just a few minutes.This way, I had my book
    ready in under an hour.A gift for you: if you like the layout of this book, email
    me at [books@soykevinalbert.com](mailto:hola@soykevinalbert.com) and I’ll send
    you my template.Publishing 2/2 (5 min.)So, here we are.My girlfriend still wasn’t
    home and I had my book almost completely finished, edited, laid out and ready
    for publication. All that was left was to upload it to Amazon.I uploaded the book…click!Mission
    accomplished: a book in one day!Not too shabby.And what if I told you that I didn’t
    just publish one book, but two: one in Spanish and one in English? Or that that
    very day, I sold three copies?I think I can say without a shadow of a doubt that
    the experiment was a runaway success, don’t you agree?'
