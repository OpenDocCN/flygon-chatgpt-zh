    you want to get the most out of the AI language model, you must understand that
    GIGO applies to ChatGPT too. Feeding unhelpful or generic information to ChatGPT

    there are limitations. The language model cannot write a full blog post – even

    ChatGPT for social media content creation, start with a topic or question related
    to your niche.

    organic recipes for newbies.” Then, you go from there.

    to get suggestions from ChatGPT. So, if your keyword is “organic food,” ask the
    bot to “Suggest five content ideas around organic food.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    suppose you get “10 easy organic meal prep ideas,” you can tweak it by adding
    “for people on a budget.”
