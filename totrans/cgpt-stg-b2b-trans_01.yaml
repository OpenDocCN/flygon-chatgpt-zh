- en: Throughout this book, I’m going to ask you to think about your sales-and-marketing
    operations as a machine. Though there are many important human considerations
    (which we’ll also explore), the front end of your business is much like a machine
    in that it puts components together (like people, processes, and tools) to translate
    inputs (like capital and OPEX) into outputs (like new customers). Inside the machine,
    there are many complex subassemblies—like the engine in a car—which are also machines
    in their own right, with their own components, inputs, and outputs.

    must be designed with its components in mind and how they optimally fit together
    to achieve an intended purpose. Sometimes the parts change so much that the overall
    machine’s design must radically change. For example, a horse or buggy did no good
    attached to a Ford Model T, and even a powerful internal combustion engine has
    no place in a modern Tesla. Disruption often prompts a complete reassessment of
    existing designs and calls for a reimagining of new designs made possible.

    things that made the machine work well a short time ago but are no longer relevant
    today. The machine’s parts have undergone radical advances with the flip of a
    switch. If your people are now immensely more capable and productive than a year
    ago, those old tools now might actually hold you back. To fully exploit the advantages
    of ChatGPT, leaders must not only drive its adoption but also overhaul organizational
    processes and tools to fit the now-very-different capabilities of personnel.

    capabilities offered by ChatGPT. Most leaders will likely underestimate just how
    much organizational processes and tools must now change to optimize productivity,
    especially considering some other factors stemming from other concurrent disruptions.
    We’ll describe several front-end use cases to introduce ChatGPT’s power in a business
    and begin to outline ChatGPT’s immense utility. We’ll develop some initial strategic
    considerations for how the front-end machine’s design can be reimagined.

    outline some strategic principles and considerations for adaptation, including
    basic adoption considerations, principles for innovating the front-end machine,
    and some important considerations for introducing change into the business at
    speed.

    adaptation strategies. Not only have the front-end machine’s parts changed, but
    the machine’s inputs and outputs also need to be reconsidered given post-COVID
    digital age disruptions. We’ll establish the revised design requirements for the
    machine.

    and enhanced capabilities of its components. Though firms will undoubtedly have
    designs unique to their own needs, our aim is to show how processes, tools, and
    structures must be reconsidered to fully realize ChatGPT’s impacts and why strategic
    considerations need to stretch well beyond mere adoption. We’ll provide several
    strategic levers that many firms can put to work immediately.

    a ChatGPT-focused transformation strategy. Rebuilding the machine is much more
    difficult when you can’t take it out of service. And though the “machine” analogy
    provides a useful context for discussing strategy, the people side to transformation
    is critical.

    And in the epilogue, leaders might find the author’s own experience writing this
    book to be illustrative of many of the challenges that leaders and employees will
    face as they tackle this new, immensely powerful technology.
