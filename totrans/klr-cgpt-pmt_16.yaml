  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenAI warns that “Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be
    unique across users,” giving the example that if you prompt “What color is the
    sky?”, the model (such as ChatGPT) is likely to return “The sky is blue,” and
    that other people are likely to get the same answer for the same prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This point is valid, but because of the way ChatGPT generates text, it usually
    *doesn't* give exactly the same answer to the exact same prompt. Briefly, ChatGPT
    uses probabilities to determine what the next word should be, but it doesn't use
    the most probable word, because that would be likely to produce the same text
    each time. Instead, ChatGPT uses a slightly lower “temperature” of probability,
    using a word that is highly probable instead of the most probable word. The result
    is more variation in the output.

    Even though your prompts are causing ChatGPT to produce the output, the U.S. Copyright
    Office does not regard you as being the author of the output. The Copyright Office
    states that “when an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output,
    the generated material is not the product of human authorship.”

    you generated the output from ChatGPT, even though you provided the prompts. Therefore,
    you cannot claim copyright for the output.
