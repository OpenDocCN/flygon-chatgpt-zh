- en: The AIDA model is a classic framework that is used to structure copywriting
    and advertising messages. It focuses on capturing the reader’s attention, arousing
    their interest, creating a desire for the product or service being offered, and
    finally inciting them to take action. This framework is best used for direct-response
    advertisements or sales pages. The AIDA framework is one of the oldest and most
    widely recognized copywriting frameworks. It dates back to the late 1800s and
    was first used by advertising pioneer Claude Hopkins.

    the attention of the target audience “Attention all coffee lovers!” and then creating
    interest in the product by highlighting its unique features and benefits “Tired
    of bland and unsatisfying coffee? Our premium coffee beans are carefully sourced
    and roasted to perfection, guaranteed to give you that rich, bold flavor you’ve
    been looking for.” The copy then creates a desire for the product by emphasizing
    the positive outcome that can be achieved “Experience the difference” and finally,
    the call-to-action (CTA) prompts the target audience to take action “Order now
    and take action towards a better coffee experience.”
