    is applied by first introducing a unique and innovative feature of the product
    “The only toothbrush with a built-in whitening system.” The copy then highlights
    the benefits of this unique feature “leaves your teeth brighter and whiter after
    every brush” and the advantages over other products “Say goodbye to messy and
    time-consuming whitening strips.” The CTA “Order now!” encourages the target audience
    to take advantage of this unique and innovative product.
