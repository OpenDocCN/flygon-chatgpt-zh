    writing of business documents and materials—everything from email messages to
    business letters and proposal documents. But ChatGPT is just as happy to help
    you with creative writing and fiction writing as with business writing.

    and fiction writing. We''ll start with using ChatGPT to blast through writer''s
    block, looking at the types of prompts you can wield to get ChatGPT to generate
    plots, scenes, and characters for you—and how you can get ChatGPT to write in
    different styles. We''ll then move on to turning ChatGPT into exactly the kind
    of helpful editor and literary critic you want to have advise you on your magnum
    opus. Finally, we''ll look briefly at how to ask ChatGPT to write poetry for you.  ##

    by a blank page, with thoughts swirling and the telltale clock ticking, but no

    moments. All you need to do is tell ChatGPT roughly what you want, whether it
    be an entire plot, a scene, or a new character.

    featuring Eris Drumsley Smith, better known as “Drumhead,” a “seasoned interstellar
    retrieval specialist”; his custom ship, the *Percussion* (uh, change that name!),
    and his AI companion, Cymbal (*definitely* change that name); and a planet called
    Strigosa, “located on the far side of a wormhole in the Vega system.”

    triggers the plot)—but he also ends up questioning the ethics of intruding into
    uncharted territories. ChatGPT noted that this “sets the stage for more adventures
    to come”—I'm imagining “Drumhead's Scherzo,” “Drumhead's Andante,” and “Drumhead's
