    by OpenAI. It falls under the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) family
    of models. Utilizing a transformer architecture, GPT models can comprehend and
    generate text resembling human language, drawing upon the input they are provided
    with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most critical skill when using ChatGPT is prompting. A prompt is a text
    you provide to start a chat or ask for a specific response from the model. When
    you interact with ChatGPT, you start the conversation with a prompt — a question,
    a statement, or any text conveying your intent.
