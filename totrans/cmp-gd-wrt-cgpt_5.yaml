  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most significant limitations of ChatGPT technology is its lack of
    understanding context. While the model can generate text that makes sense, it
    may not always consider the context of the conversation. For example, if someone
    asks "What's the weather like today?" and then follows up with "How about tomorrow?",
    ChatGPT may not realize that the second question is related to the first and may
    provide an unrelated response.
