    framework is applied by presenting the target audience with a problem (weight
    loss) and offering a solution (the proven weight loss program). The use of “easy-to-follow
    meal plans” and “expert support” further emphasize the benefits of the program
    and increase the desire for the solution. The CTA, “Don’t wait, sign up now and
    start losing weight today,” is a clear and direct call to action, urging the audience
    to take immediate action and join the program.
