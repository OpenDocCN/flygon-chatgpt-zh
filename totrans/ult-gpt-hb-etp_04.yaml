    in *[Chapter 2, CapabilityGPT – An Enterprise AI-Capability Framework for ChatGPT](c02.xhtml)*,
    and examined their transformative impact for enterprise roles in *[Chapter 3](c03.xhtml),
    The Impact of ChatGPT on the Enterprise*. We have also seen in *[Chapter 4, Architecture
    Patterns enabled by GPT-Models](c04.xhtml)*, how these advanced capabilities,
    when combined with the right solution architecture patterns, can lead to a new
    generation of intelligent systems. Central to harnessing these AI capabilities
    is the practice of prompt engineering, the technique of effectively communicating
    with GPT models.

    with the ChatGPT chatbot, developing specialized applications with GPT at their
    core, or leveraging GPT-enhanced enterprise solutions like Microsoft Copilot.
    It’s the process of crafting precise, contextually relevant prompts that allow
    us to produce the desired response from the model.

    Multi Agent Prompting, each addressing unique challenges and scenarios when communicating
    with GPT models.

    on the CapabilityGPT framework introduced in *[Chapter 2](c02.xhtml)*, this technique
    presents a structured approach for conveying specific tasks or actions to a GPT
    model. The subsequent in-depth dissection will navigate through its three variants:
    Single Instruction, Instruction Sequence, and Pseudo-Code Instructions. Their
    efficacy is then brought to light through real-world examples that accentuate
    their pragmatic applications.'

    and analytical scenarios, also when faced with ambiguity and incomplete information.
    Throughout this section we distinguish between various query types, including
    information-seeking, comparative, predictive and counterfactual queries and present
    detailed examples for each query type.

    excels in situations where tasks cannot be strictly defined upfront, requiring

    examples in an enterprise context.

    that guides a GPT model toward more accurate and appropriate responses. It could
    involve background information or specific details about a scenario; for example,
    ‘Our company launched three marketing campaigns in the last quarter.’ Context

    of one serving as the input for the next. An example would be: ‘1\. Extract the

    strategies, including social media campaigns and influencer partnerships. This

    Summer 2021 brought an unexpected surge in sales, peaking at 600 units in July,

    for warm-season skincare. A slight dip followed in the fall, down to 400 units
    per month, but sales rebounded during the holiday season in November and December
    to an average of 550 units per month. January 2022 saw a minor slump to 350 units
    due to post-holiday saturation and budget constraints. Sales then stabilized for
    the first quarter at an average of 400 units per month. The launch of a new product
    variant in April 2022 rejuvenated the sales, jumping to 700 units, and an average
    of 650 units were maintained per month thereafter. By the end of July 2023, over
    8,000 units had been sold, reflecting the product’s steady demand and growing
    popularity. August 2023 marked a pivotal moment, with the company’s back-to-school

    feature, providing hours of uninterrupted use on a single charge. StreamSmith’s
    gesture control system is also intuitive, making the operation effortless. Additionally,

    hand, where the V35s disappoint is their sound quality, which is notably less
    impressive than competitors in the same price range. There is a noticeable lack
    of depth in the low-end frequencies, making the bass sound slightly hollow. The
    higher tones also seem to lack clarity, creating an overall flat soundstage. This,

    a truly stellar audio experience. Overall, the StreamSmith V35s represent a promising
    step forward, especially in terms of design and user interface. However, for the
