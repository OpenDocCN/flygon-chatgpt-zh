    States.  Sales have never been greater, and readers are looking for romance fiction
    in all themes and book lengths to satisfy their compulsion for this genre. The
    good news for writers is that there has never been a better time to create your
    own romance stories and find readers who will enjoy them.

    virtual bookshelves called Categories, where readers can find the kind of eBooks
    and printed books they love to read. This is the online equivalent of labeled
    shelves in a bricks and mortar bookstore.

    your work should be listed on the Amazon bookstore. A book does not have to be
