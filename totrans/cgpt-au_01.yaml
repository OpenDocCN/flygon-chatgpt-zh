- en: 'CHAPTER 1ChatGPT: The writer’s best allyAs I explained in [Self-Publishing
    Secrets](https://soykevinalbert.com/sps), every writer, whether they are a well-known
    bestselling author on the New York Times list or a total newbie taking their first
    steps in the literary world, has faced or will face a series of common obstacles:
    writer’s block, imposter syndrome, lack of time or motivation…the list goes on.What
    if I told you that you no longer have to face these dreaded obstacles alone?Imagine:
    you’ve had a long day at work and your brain is fried. The last thing you feel
    like doing is sitting down to write. But you promised yourself, or your editor,
    and you need to do a few more paragraphs if you don’t want to go to bed feeling
    like a failure – or worse, out of a job because you didn’t meet your deadlines.
    You stare at the blinking cursor and inwardly scream: “I wish someone could give
    me a hand!”.Enter your new friend and colleague, ChatGPT. Whether you decide to
    get up at the crack of dawn or keep writing until the early hours, ChatGPT will
    be your knight in shining armor. All you have to do is write a few words, and
    artificial intelligence will get to work and write you your first few paragraphs
    or suggest a series of ideas to inspire you and get you out of that rut. It’s
    like having a personal trainer, except this one doesn’t keep telling you to do
    burpees.But let’s say the words are coming pretty easily and you’re writing enough
    to make good progress. Even so, you feel like something doesn’t fit. You write,
    you delete, you correct, over and over. Welcome to my “favorite” block: perfection
    paralysis. My fellow perfectionist, take a deep breath. ChatGPT is here to save
    the day.Not convinced by a paragraph or chapter? No problem. Ask ChatGPT to rewrite
    it for you until it comes up with a version that finally silences the perfectionist
    whispering in your ear.Already read and reread your book twenty times looking
    for errors or spelling mistakes? Try asking ChatGPT to check your text. You’ll
    be surprised at how well it can correct and discover little mistakes that even
    the most experienced editor would be hard pressed to spot. Don’t believe me? Put
    a book you’ve already published and believe to be “perfect” through ChatGPT and
    tell me what you think.We can’t forget one of the most common blocks I see in
    my clients: imposter syndrome. The belief that you’re a fraud, whether because
    of insecurity about your own writing skills or because you question the quality
    of your work. Maybe ChatGPT can free you from your inner doubt (although this
    may be a job for a life coach or psychologist), but it can certainly help you
    continue your writing process in several different ways:'

    of time or motivation. I know, particularly when you don’t make a living from
    your writing, that finding the time to do it can present a real challenge. Before,
    I would have agreed with you: dedicating what little free time you have in a day
    to sitting in front of a computer and ending up writing little to nothing would
    dishearten anyone.But now, with ChatGPT, there’s no excuse. What you couldn’t
    manage in two hours before, you can now easily do in a half hour, leaving you
    with time to do the things you really want to. Plus, spending two hours every
    day staring at a blank screen is not the same as watching your book take shape
    before your very eyes. I promise you that the motivation you derive from this
    will make you want to spend more time writing, even when you don’t have to.In
    short, think of ChatGPT as your colleague, copilot, or secret weapon in the battle
    against your writing challenges. Like any good colleague, it’s not there to replace
    you. On the contrary: it’s there to support you, complement you, and maybe give
    you a little kick up the ass when you need it.Remember that the best thing about
    being a writer is…writing. So let’s make the process a little pleasant, fun and
    much easier than ever before.'
