- en: Within a mere five days of its release, ChatGPT reached an impressive one million
    users, sending shock waves throughout the tech industry and beyond. As a side
    effect, the OpenAI API for AI-powered text generation was suddenly brought to
    light, despite having been available for three years. The ChatGPT interface showcased
    the potential of such language models, and suddenly developers and inventors began
    to realize the incredible possibilities available at their fingertips.

- en: The field of natural language processing has made incredible technical progress
    over the years, but until recently, use of the technology was limited to an elite
    few. The OpenAI API and its accompanying libraries provide a ready-to-use solution
    for anyone seeking to build AI-powered applications. There is no need to have
    powerful hardware or deep knowledge of artificial intelligence; with just a few
    lines of code, developers can integrate incredible features into their projects
    at a reasonable cost.

    as a software engineer, to give you a broad understanding of how to develop applications
    with GPT-4 and ChatGPT. In these pages, you will find clear and detailed explanations
    of AI concepts, as well as user-friendly guidelines on how to integrate the OpenAI
    services effectively, securely, and cost-consciously.
