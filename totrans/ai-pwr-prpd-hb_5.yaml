- en: Mamdooh is a hardworking PhD student who also teaches school and undergraduates
    on a part-time basis to support his studies. He uses Skype and Zoom to instruct
    advanced students and evaluate their progress by customizing tests for each student
    based on their subject, level, and performance. While Mamdooh enjoys creating
    his own tests, the process is incredibly time-consuming, particularly given the
    need to customize each test for individual students.

- en: Everyday we try to find happyness in a complete caos, that's what we struggle
    for. Actually, temprary happyness is evrywhre if we want to find it and search
    for it. Sometimes it is just as close as a cute kitn to us, sometimes givin a
    hand to someone who is in need of us is enough. Even takin a breth may give somebody
    the absolute happyness at times. But what if we leave temprary happyness alone
    and decide to constrct our lives on basic principls of permanent happyness? Cirtainly
    these principls depend on one's charactaristics and point of view. In my opinion,
    social relations, acceptance and independence are the most important elemnts of
    permanent happyness in life.

- en: To begin with, socal relations are very important for me to be happy in the
    general drift of my life. I should have good relations with the people around
    me for peace of my mind. If I have close and intimate frends with whom I can share
    my trubbles, woris and also my joy, then it means that I have beaten the life
    up to a very considerable point. In my opinion, someone who has real frends has
    the most valuable treasure of life. In order to obtain this treasure, I make my
    frends among the people whose principles resemble mine, whose characteristics
    best suit me and who are sincere. Besides frends I try to have good relations
    with the people I encounter somehow everyday, like neighbors, acquaintances, teachers,
    relatives and the others.

- en: 'The second elemnt of continuous happyness for me is acceptance: to clarify,
    acceptance of my characteristics, behaviors, choices and desires. At one point,
    it can be defined as the acceptance of my existence as a real individual. As long
    as I am accepted and taken as I am, I can make right decisions for myself. To
    accomplish this, I explain that I don''t want unnecessary criticisms from the
    people around me. Unless the things I do or think affect anybody, the others should
    not poke their nose into them. It is none of their business to interfere with
    me about the subjects that only interest me.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To sum up, if I aquire success in social relations, independence and acceptance,
    then it means that I have the golden key to make happyness an enduring elemnt
    of my life. Obtaining all these elemnts may not be very easy, they may be achieved
    only in the long run but there is something we should always bear in mind, achieving
    the real and permanent happyness in life is not that easy, either
