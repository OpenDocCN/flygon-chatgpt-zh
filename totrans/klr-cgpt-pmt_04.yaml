- en: IF YOUR WORK includes creating any type of business documents, make sure you
    take advantage of ChatGPT's capabilities to save yourself time and effort. ChatGPT
    can create a wide range of business documents — everything from short memos and
    business letters all the way through to business plans and long-form sales letters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we'll look at prompts you can give ChatGPT to write copy for
    ads, social media, and other uses; prompts to write proposals; and prompts to
    write business letters. At the end of the chapter, we'll examine prompts for getting
    ChatGPT to edit and proofread your work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As when working with an assistant or a colleague, you should carefully review
    the material ChatGPT provides for you before using it. In many cases, you'll want
    to tweak the material further to personalize it or to make it express exactly
    what you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and web pages (see [Chapters 2](c02.xhtml) and [7](c07.xhtml), respectively).

    by looking at how you work with ChatGPT on creating documents.  ## Understand
    How You Work on Documents with ChatGPT'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you saw in [Chapters 2](c02.xhtml) and [3](c03.xhtml), ChatGPT doesn't have
    access to your computer's file system as of this writing, so it cannot create
    new document files or work with your existing files. Similarly, ChatGPT cannot
    log in to your online accounts, such as your Microsoft 365 account or your Dropbox
    account, so it cannot create or access files in those online accounts, either.
    ChatGPT is confined to your web browser or to the ChatGPT app on your iPhone,
    iPad, or Android device.

- en: 'This limitation helps protect you and your data by preventing ChatGPT from
    taking unauthorized or unwise actions in your computer''s file system or your
    online accounts. That''s sensible, given the potential for damage, but it means
    that when you''re working with ChatGPT, you''re the one who must perform any document
    creation or manipulation. When you''re using ChatGPT to create a new document,
    ChatGPT can supply the content, but you have to copy that content to a file and
    save the file. When you want ChatGPT to work on an existing file, you must copy
    that file''s content and paste it into the Send a Message box to pass it to ChatGPT.
    If ChatGPT''s work with the file produces output you want to save, you''ll need
    to copy the output and paste it into a file.  ## Write Copy'
  prefs: []

    it more quickly and with less effort. And if your job involves commissioning others
    to write copy, you should see how much of that copy ChatGPT can produce and how
    much you still need to assign to human copywriters.
