- en: This book was completed about six months after ChatGPT was released for public
    use. Just six months earlier, nobody had heard of ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, or the
    many other generative AI tools. At that time, it looked like technology might
    displace jobs like factory workers (automation and robotics), call-center operators
    (relocation and outsourcing), and eventually truck drivers (autonomous vehicles).
    Today, it looks more like accountants, lawyers, doctors, and programmers—all due
    to the monumental advances offered by language models. Today, *digital transformation*
    has a completely different meaning and strategy than it did just six months ago.
    The game has reset and changed, and what the next several months or years will
    look like is anybody’s guess.

    they need to get their hands dirty and *use ChatGPT* to fully grasp its capabilities
    and the disruption it will have on their business. Your eyes will open, and you’ll
    realize just how much things have changed. Through using it, you’ll realize that
    people’s habits must change and that leaders must set expectations and provide
    a strong-motive force for adoption.

    Success in the future will matter less about how smart you are or how hard you
    work and more about how you’re using this technology. With technologies now smarter
    than ourselves, which can now communicate like people, using those technologies
    will be the critical success factor over the next several years. Firms who put
    these tools to work sooner will reap compound interest that laggards just won’t
    be able to ever catch. Beyond the tools available in the public domain, firms
    that localize, train, and build interfaces to these technologies will gain an
    even further edge.
