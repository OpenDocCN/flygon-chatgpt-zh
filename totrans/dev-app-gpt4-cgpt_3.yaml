- en: The provision of GPT-4 and ChatGPT models behind an API service has introduced
    new capabilities for developers. It is now possible to build intelligent applications
    that can understand and respond to natural language without requiring any deep
    knowledge of AI. From chatbots and virtual assistants to content creation and
    language translation, LLMs are being used to power a wide range of applications
    across different industries.

    you must have an API key to access the OpenAI services. Managing API keys has
    implications for your application design, so it is a topic to handle from the
    start. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html#a_deep_dive_into_the_gpt_4_and_chatgpt_apis),

    API key, the good news is that you run no risk of unwanted charges from OpenAI.
    Also, you only need an API key for testing purposes. However, the downside is

    not taking any risks by using your application.

    the API will be called from the code executed on their device.

    starts might be an issue, and you might have to store the key locally on the user’s
    device. Alternatively, you could use an environment variable, or even use the
    OpenAI convention and expect the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to be set. This last
    option might not always be practical, however, as your users might not know how
    to manipulate environment variables.
