- en: While ChatGPT has many impressive capabilities, it is not without limitations.
    One significant limitation is its tendency to generate responses that may be biased
    or inappropriate. This is due to the fact that the model's training data reflects
    the biases and perspectives of its creators and sources.

- en: In addition, ChatGPT may sometimes generate responses that are nonsensical or
    off-topic, especially when presented with input that is outside of its training
    data. This can be frustrating for users who expect the model to generate coherent
    and contextually relevant responses.
