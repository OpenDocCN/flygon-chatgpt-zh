- en: ChatGPT leapt onto the scene in November 2022\. It is already disrupting businesses
    and industries like higher education, similar to the printing press and the internet.
    At its core, chatGPT uses artificial intelligence to compose responses to queries
    spanning numerous topics.

    chatGPT because they see it as a way for students to cheat. In contrast, others
    see it as a tool to extend learning. As an instructional technologist, I see great
    potential in chatGPT. I have already started using it to support the faculty I
    work with.

- en: When asked, chatGPT explained that it *is a pre-trained language model created
    by OpenAI. It is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model
    and is trained on a large dataset of conversational text. It can be fine-tuned
    for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation,
    question answering, and text completion. It can also be used to generate human-like
    text for tasks such as chatbot development and language generation.*

    such as Jasper, Sudowrite, Quillbot, etc. It builds on Grammarly, the Hemingway
    app, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and others. Historically, education has pushed
    back on new technologies entering the field, such as writing, printing press,
    slide rulers, calculators, computers, word processors, spell checkers, grammar
    checkers, the internet, Wikipedia, open educational resources, etc.

    collection of dialogue from various sources such as books, movies, and websites.
    OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the specific dataset used to train the model.
    The training dataset is vast, with over a billion words, used to train the model
    to learn the nuances of conversational language and generate human-like responses.

- en: OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the specific data used to train ChatGPT. However,
    they prepared the model with a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of factual
    information such as historical events, science, technology, and general knowledge.
    The training data came from various sources such as books, articles, and websites
    that provide accurate and reliable information. Additionally, the model could
    have been fine-tuned on specific factual datasets to improve its performance on
    certain tasks, although this information is not publicly available.
