- en: To ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly in the realm of creativity,
    it is important to consider the potential impacts on human workers. This could
    include ensuring that AI is used in a way that complements and enhances human
    creativity, rather than replacing it. It may also be necessary to consider measures

- en: Another ethical consideration is the potential for AI to perpetuate biases that
    are present in the data it is trained on. For example, if an AI system is trained
    on a dataset that is heavily biased towards a certain race or gender, it may produce
    creative outputs that are biased in the same way. To address this issue, it is
    important to ensure that the datasets used to train AI systems are diverse and

- en: In schools, NLG can be used to help students generate written assignments and
    projects, allowing them to focus more on critical thinking and analysis rather
    than spending time on mundane writing tasks. However, there are also ethical concerns
    to consider when using NLG in education. One concern is that students may rely
    too heavily on NLG and lose the ability to express themselves creatively and effectively
