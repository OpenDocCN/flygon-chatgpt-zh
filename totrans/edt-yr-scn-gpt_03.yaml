- en: The thing that yanks your protagonist out of his ordinary life. Yes, it’s that
    simple. The term “Inciting Incident” is often used in screenwriting and movie
    production as well as novel writing, but we chose to call it “conflict” because
    it’s more specific. This single event does not necessarily need to be tense, dramatic,
    or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting incident will depend on
    your genre. However, it does need to force the main character into changing, which
    then “incites” the story. Without change precipitated by conflict, there is no
    story.

    this: There must be a choice. In all of my client work over the years, this is
    the single-most challenging concept for most authors to conceptualize.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Choice is a difficult decision the protagonist must face, born from a challenging
    question with equally wonderful or horrific consequences. The best Choice in any
    story leaves the reader (1) arguing with himself over which option is best for
    the character and (2) unable to put the book down, insistent on finding out what
    the character decides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Determining the intensity of the Choice is often a case of splitting hairs and
    not nearly as important as making sure the question facing the main character
    is a supremely difficult one. We are compelled to turn the page or keep watching
    when we empathize with the character, running the odds on the consequence of the
    decision as if it were our own. Make it difficult on the character and your reader
    will follow.

    the action that resets the life of the protagonist. She’s had her life upended,
    gone through a series of ordeals, been forced to make a difficult decision, and
    then suffered the consequence of that decision. So, what now?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authors misunderstand what makes a compelling scene, thinking it must be action-packed
    or with life and death stakes. That’s not true. You can write a very compelling
    and gripping scene with two people having a dinner conversation. But you must
    have that initial Conflict, a Choice, and its Consequence. If you have those three
    elements, then your scene will always be compelling, even without big drama or
    high stakes.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s genre dependent, although you should be able to write a great scene in
    2,000 words or less. Some genre conventions prefer shorter scenes, some longer.
    Scenes of 1,500 to 2,000 words make it easy for readers to read “just one more”
    before going to bed. If they skip ahead and see a massive chapter, they may not
    want to start it. And once a reader puts a book down, there’s no guarantee they’ll
    ever pick it up again. Your goal as the author is to make it impossible for a
    reader to put your book down. You should be the reason they had to stay up all
    night and were late to work in the morning. Because of reading. Just wanted to
    clarify that.

- en: Word economy and efficiency. Especially when I write short stories, I struggle
    with every word I put in there. I get to where I’m trying to decide between a
    proper name or a personal pronoun. Words do matter. Mark Twain supposedly once
    wrote, “I didn’t have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long
    one.” It’s harder to underwrite than overwrite. Use as few words as possible to
    get your point across. That applies even more so in nonfiction than fiction. If
    you’re writing a memoir, or narrative nonfiction, or a blog post, or sales copy,
    use as few words as possible. <-Not like that. Terrible example.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    plot forward, or it shouldn’t be there. Making sure that every scene contains
    the 3Cs will make it compelling and necessary.

- en: I firmly believe that if you can write a great scene, then it makes writing
    a novel easier. There’s probably not a more important component of Story than
    the scene. We know readers now are fickle and sophisticated. They won’t wait long
    to be entertained. If you can’t write good scenes, they will not stick around
    for the rest of the story.

    it’s challenging to self-evaluate, so get yourself an accountability partner.
    Swap rubrics and help each other evaluate your scenes. Because the rubric is objective,
    you should be able to measure progress.

    A story has to have a beginning, middle, and end. But that doesn’t mean every
    story is the same because it has those components. It’s not a recipe. It’s not
    a lockstep program. It’s more of an approach.
