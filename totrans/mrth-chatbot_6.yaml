    bring, with a focus on bias. Bias in AI in general, and regarding language models
    in particular, is a topic that was neglected for many years of technology development.
    In the recent years, after some disturbing examples of discrimination caused by
    bias in AI software have made it to the broad media, the topic is explored by
    research and finally starts getting the attention it deserves.^([1](#Fn1)) We
    will also discuss other risks such as the ecological footprint or the sometimes
    critical working conditions behind the scenes of machine learning training.

    When encoding single words into vectors, we identified the word *queen* based
    on the word vectors of the words *king*, *man,* and *woman*. We phrased this fact
    as vector computation earlier but can also describe it in text form as follows:'

    learned by the way these words appeared in the textual training data. When two
    words appear in context with the same words, they are assumed to be more similar.
    More similar words have vectors that are closer together in the vector space.
    The possibility to compute the word *queen* based on mathematical operations arises
    from the fact that there is a similar relation between *king* and *man*, as for
    *queen* and *woman*. This relation was thus present in the training data (large
    quantity of text samples) that was fed to the training process when generating
    the word embeddings. Whereas this is not a very problematic relation in this case,
    the training data can also include stereotypes of our society, allowing calculations
    as the following ones (Bolukbasi et al. [2016](#CR4)):'

    by our society is reflected in these applications. Let me use an example to illustrate
    this. In the simple chatbot in the previous chapter, we took the sentence embedding
    of the user’s question and tried to find the most similar sentence from a given
    text (the article about strawberries). Using a similar technology, we could map
    a short personal description of a person to job ads, finding the best match. This
    could be used to place advertisements correctly or rank the search results in
    job search engines.

    On the other side, the lack of explainability comes from the way the deep learning
    methods are implemented. This lack of transparency hinders the identification

    more. In addition, these types of bias do not only occur one by one but in an
    intersectional manner. One person can be part of different of the beforementioned
    groups, and additional stereotypes can apply to combinations of these groups.
    From the technical side, the way these stereotypes can be expressed in language

- en: Training a classifier that identifies inappropriate, violent, or offensive content
    requires a large number of text samples. Ideally, these text samples need to be
    reviewed by human annotators, to ensure they are *good representatives* of the
    kind of texts we do *not* want to see in our chatbot’s answers.

    As reported by the *TIME* investigation (Perrigo [2023](#CR30)), the concerned
    texts contained details about child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide,
    torture, self-harm, and incest. This task, the manual classification or ranking
    of disturbing contents, was outsourced from Silicon Valley to the Kenyan laborers
    working for 2 dollars the hour.

    conditions for human annotators of training data to machine learning are more
    a problem of the whole industry, and it often happens unnoticed behind the scenes.
    And it does not stop there. Similarly, human workers, often in the Global South,
    might be employed for content monitoring in social media or stepping in to support
    chatbots behind the scenes to improve their answers and thus the perceived performance
    of the software.

    of billions of parameters requires powerful hardware and takes a moment to execute.
    What about the environmental price we pay for this?

- en: First studies have come up with concrete numbers of the CO[2] consumption for
    these training processes. In particular, it was shown (Strubell et al. [2019](#CR35))
    that training the BERT base model with 110 million parameters on GPU hardware
    corresponds roughly to the CO[2] emission of a trans-American flight. This considers
    only the training process itself for one model, not the development of it. Typically,
    when doing hyperparameter tuning as we have seen earlier, a multiple of energy
    and thus CO[2] will be consumed for the overall process before reaching the final
    model. Whereas a human is responsible for around 5 t CO[2] emissions per year,
    the development of such a model can reach values of 284 t of CO[2] (Bender et
    al. [2021](#CR3)), based on (Strubell et al. [2019](#CR35)). This computational
    technique of brute-force testing (Crawford [2021](#CR9)) to systematically gather
    more data and use more computational cycles to optimize the results continuously
    increases the energy consumption.

- en: This discussion is followed up by Bender et al. ([2021](#CR3)), leading to the
    interesting question of whether it is fair that countries suffering from floods
    due to climate change are paying the price for training large language models,
    with the primary focus on English and some other privileged languages, rarely
    covering the local languages of those countries. The authors point out that there
    is an urgent need for researchers in this field to prioritize energy and cost
    to reduce the negative environmental impact and inequitable access to resources.
    This inclusion problem of distribution of efforts to different languages is underlined
    by a study from 2020 that stated that only a small number of the 7000 languages
    of the world are represented in language technology (Joshi et al. [2020](#CR23)).
    There is still a lot of work to do to bring the field of natural language processing
    to an inclusive and fair path.

    to language models. Stereotypes that are encoded in word embeddings or language
    models might impact the predictions of machine learning software. The use cases,
    ethical working conditions, and ecological concerns are important to be addressed
    to make a responsible use of AI technologies.

    a useful tool to humans. We will have an outlook on how language models and humans
    might work, learn, and teach in the digital society in the coming years in the
    next and last chapter.
