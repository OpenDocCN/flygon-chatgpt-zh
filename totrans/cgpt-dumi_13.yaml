    Poruk Baker, and my all inspiring and joy-infusing granddaughter crew: Mirabel,
    Coco, Poppy, and Charlotte. Special thanks to Ben for being my sounding board
    and technical adviser as I sorted out the details of the very new and incredibly
    fast-evolving ChatGPT. Thanks to Katherine for letting me use her office down
    by the sea. The two cats, Luna and Cinny, were an extra nice touch guys. Thanks
    to Stephanie for bringing your all every single time to every situation. To all
    of you, thanks for being my inspiration and support team through this and other
    writing marathons and for rocking my world.'

- en: In the best of times, producing a book is a huge undertaking requiring many
    highly skilled and creative people to manifest the book in the real world. But
    this book pushed our collective and considerable skills to the limit given the
    newness of the technology and the speed in which it was evolving, as well as the
    crushing deadlines required to keep pace and produce a book worthy of our readers.
