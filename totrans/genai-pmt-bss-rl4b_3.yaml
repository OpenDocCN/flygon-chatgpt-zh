    is a revolutionary technique that enables algorithmic individuals to develop models
    that were previously dependent on humans, resulting in creative solutions that
    are free of faults caused by human cognition and experience. This new technique
    in artificial intelligence determines the raw model input to generate a real-world
    product that demonstrates the characteristics of the training data. MIT Technology
    Review pointed out that generative AI is a potential direction in artificial intelligence.Generative
    AI delivers better quality results through autonomous learning on all datasets.
    As a result, challenges associated with specific projects are reduced, and ML
    (machine learning) algorithms are trained to avoid bias and allow robots to understand
    abstract concepts.Gartner, a high-quality foreign consulting company, mentioned
    Generative AI in the list of significant trends in 2022 and emphasized that enterprises
    can use this innovative technology in two ways: Work with the business to enhance
    current innovation work and lows: develop automation to help humans perform creative
    tasks better. For example, game designers can leverage generative AI to create
    dungeons that highlight their likes and dislikes, such as "kind of like this"
    or "not quite like that." Serving as an essential part of business processes:
    Generative AI can produce countless creative works with little human involvement.
    It just needs to set the context, and the result will be generated independently.Generative
    AI is the part of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning models to
    create new outputs based on a training set. In other words, generative AI enables
    algorithms to develop things like humans rather than the standard analytical nature
    of AI systems.These outputs range from deep fakes to AI chatbots, text-to-image
    and text-to-video creations, music, paintings, and more. Thanks to improvements
    in hardware and new machine learning methods in recent years, generative AI output
    has also become so good, if not excellent. This write-up briefly introduces the
    basics and applications of generative AI and how they can impact your personal
    life and business.Humans are good at analyzing things. But machines are even more
    potent. The device can analyze a set of data and find a pattern that applies to
    many use cases, whether those are fraud or spam detection, predicting the ETA
    (estimated time of arrival) of delivery, or predicting what TikTok will show following
    more over; they are getting more competent at performing these tasks. This is
    the so-called "Analytical AI" (Analytical AI) or traditional artificial intelligence. 
    But humans aren''t just good at analyzing things—we''re also good at creating.
    We can write poetry, design products, develop games and write code. Until recently,
    machines could not compete with humans in creative work—they were limited to analytical
    and rote cognitive labor. However, device machines are improving at creating sensuous
    and beautiful things. This new category is "generative AI," It refers to devices
    that make something new rather than evaluating what already exists. Not only is
    generative AI getting faster and cheaper, but in some cases, it can create things
    even better than humans. Every industry that requires original human work faces
    reinvention, from social media to gaming, from advertising to architecture, from
    coding to graphic design, from product design to law, and from marketing to sales.
    Some functions in these industries may be entirely replaced by generative artificial
    intelligence. In contrast, other departures are more likely to flourish under
    the influence of more frequent creative loops brought about by human-machine collaboration,
    but in a wide range. As a result, Generative AI should unleash better, faster,
    and cheaper creativity in many end markets. We dream that generative AI will reduce
    the marginal cost of creation and knowledge work to zero, creating extremely high
    labor productivity, economic value, and a correspondingly large market value. The
    fields of generative AI — knowledge work and creative work — involve billions
    of workers. Generative AI could make these workers at least 10% more efficient
    and innovative: they would become faster, more efficient, and more capable than
    before. As a result, generative AI has the potential to produce billions of dollars
    in economic value.'

    AI）或传统人工智能。但人类不仅擅长分析事物，我们还擅长创造。我们可以写诗，设计产品，开发游戏和编写代码。直到最近，机器无法在创造性工作方面与人类竞争——它们局限于分析和机械性认知劳动。然而，设备机器正在改进，可以创造感性和美丽的事物。这个新类别是“生成式人工智能”，它指的是制造新事物而不是评估已经存在的事物。生成式人工智能不仅变得更快更便宜，而且在某些情况下，它甚至可以比人类创造出更好的东西。需要原创人类工作的每个行业都面临着重塑，从社交媒体到游戏，从广告到建筑，从编码到图形设计，从产品设计到法律，从营销到销售。这些行业中的一些功能可能完全被生成式人工智能取代，而其他部门更有可能在人机协作带来更频繁的创造循环的影响下蓬勃发展，但范围广泛。因此，生成式人工智能应该在许多终端市场释放更好、更快和更便宜的创造力。我们梦想生成式人工智能将把创作和知识工作的边际成本降低到零，创造极高的劳动生产率、经济价值和相应的巨大市场价值。生成式人工智能的领域——知识工作和创造性工作——涉及数十亿工作者。生成式人工智能可以使这些工作者至少提高10%的效率和创新能力：他们将比以前更快、更高效、更有能力。因此，生成式人工智能有潜力创造数十亿美元的经济价值。'
