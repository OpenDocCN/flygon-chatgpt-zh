    the heart and soul of any story. Their motivations, emotions, and physical states
    drive the plot forward and elicit emotional responses from the readers. By delving
    into these aspects, authors ensure a multi-dimensional representation of their
    characters, enhancing the overall depth and authenticity of the narrative.

    ailment affecting their decisions or a chronic condition shaping their worldview.

    each detail. If there are minor characters, even a brief acknowledgment can offer
    clarity and prevent any confusion during the analysis. Remember, the more vividly
    and comprehensively you define your characters, the better the feedback will be
    in understanding their role and impact within the scene.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    moment that disrupts the protagonist’s status quo. When identifying the conflict,
    think about what event or situation forces your protagonist to change or take
    action. It doesn’t have to be a grand, dramatic event; sometimes, subtle conflicts
    can be just as powerful. But it should be significant enough to make the protagonist—and
    the reader—sit up and take notice.'

    faced with a decision. This choice should be challenging. It should have stakes.

    decision for your character, the more engaged your reader will be. It’s this uncertainty,
    this weighing of options, that keeps readers turning the page.'

    decision. When detailing the consequence, think about its impact on the protagonist’s
    journey and how it sets up future events or conflicts in the story. Ideally, consequences
    should be both surprising yet inevitable. They should feel organic to the story,
    something that readers didn’t see coming, but in hindsight, feels like the only
    logical outcome.'

    call it “conflict” because it’s more specific. This single event does not necessarily
    need to be tense, dramatic, or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting
    incident will depend on your genre. However, it does need to force the main character
    into changing, which then “incites” the story. Without change precipitated by
    conflict, there is no story.)

    Choice in any scene leaves the reader arguing with himself over which option is
    best for the character and unable to put the book down, insistent on finding out
    what the character decides. Determining the intensity of the Choice is often a
    case of splitting hairs and not nearly as important as making sure the question
    facing the main character is a supremely difficult one. We are compelled to turn
    the page or keep watching when we empathize with the character, running the odds
    on the consequence of the decision as if it were our own. Make it difficult on
