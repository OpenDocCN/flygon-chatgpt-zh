  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Pre-training: During this phase, ChatGPT-4 is exposed to a large corpus of
    text from diverse sources, such as books, articles, and websites. The model learns
    the structure and patterns of natural language by predicting the next word in
    a sentence, gradually improving its understanding of grammar, facts, and reasoning
    abilities.'

- en: 'Fine-tuning: After pre-training, ChatGPT-4 is fine-tuned on a more specific
    dataset, often generated with the help of human reviewers. This dataset contains
    prompts and appropriate responses, allowing the model to learn how to produce
    more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate output. The fine-tuning
    process can be adapted to target specific industries, applications, or use cases.'
