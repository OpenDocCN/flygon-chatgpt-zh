- en: 'CHAPTER 3Humanize your manuscriptWe have already seen how ChatGPT can help
    you both to overcome typical writer’s block and to optimize and accelerate your
    writing process, turning you into a regular Shakespeare on steroids.Fantastic.
    But, believe it or not, writing quickly and well may not be enough.I’m sure that
    more than once you have bought a book based solely on who wrote it. Right? Because
    when an author can get us to fall in love with their style or personality, they’ve
    won us over forever. That’s why it’s so important to give your text a human touch,
    and if possible, a unique voice.So, how do you do this? How can you ensure that
    your work keeps that human touch? Let’s start with the basics: tone, rhythm and
    vocabulary. The combination of these will define your style, and mixed in the
    right proportions, will create an emotional link with your readers that will hook
    them and have them coming back for more.First, we have the tone. The tone of your
    writing is like the background music in a movie scene. It creates atmosphere.
    If you’re a non-fiction author writing a motivational self-help book, you might
    want a positive, constructive tone. If you’re a fiction writer, you might prefer
    a romantic, mysterious tone. The trick is to make sure that ChatGPT understands
    the tone you’re looking for. To do this, give it examples of texts written in
    that tone.Then, we have the rhythm. The beat to your literary symphony. Some like
    it fast and intermittent, like a thriller. Others prefer a gentle, fluid style,
    like the serene beauty of a literary masterpiece. In any case, once you are clear
    on the rhythm you want your work to have, just ask ChatGPT and it will generate
    a text in accordance with your instructions.Finally, we have the vocabulary: the
    words you like the best or which best represent you. For better or for worse,
    ChatGPT can’t read your mind (yet). But, of course, you can train it. Explicitly
    use your favorite words in your prompts and indications, or directly ask it to
    analyze extracts from texts written by you or by the author you’re trying to emulate.But
    remember, although the tone, rhythm and vocabulary are crucial elements in humanizing
    your text, there is something deeper you cannot forget: your creative soul. Your
    experiences, thoughts and feelings are what truly breathe life into your writing.
    ChatGPT can provide the words, but the essence and meaning behind them come from
    you.To help your writing assistant understand your inner world, don’t hesitate
    to share with it your thoughts, ideas and deepest emotions. Don’t worry, ChatGPT
    is programmed to keep your data confidential.Because humanizing your book is not
    just about giving your writing a personalized tone, rhythm and vocabulary, but
    about putting your soul into the words you choose and the ideas you decide to
    share. ChatGPT is a powerful ally on this journey, but always remember that it
    is just a tool: the real author will always be you.Ultimately, what really matters
    is the relationship you build with your readers. Let them feel you in every word
    they read, let them know you and recognize you in every line and every idea. This
    way, not only will you be writing – you will be sharing a part of yourself with
    the world.Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable, authentic, human. Because that’s what
    really set a writer apart from a text generator. When your readers read your words,
    let them see you, not just letters on a page. Let them see the spark you have
    inside.'
