- en: In the worked example, the breakdown for chapter one in the worked example has
    given us 7 scenes to introduce our hero, Jack. If you were writing a novella,
    it would be challenging to cram 7 scenes of content into 1,562 words of chapter
    1 of 16 chapters.

  zh: 在这个示例中，对第一章进行的分解给了我们7个场景来介绍我们的英雄杰克。如果你正在写一部中篇小说，将7个场景的内容塞进16章中的第1章的1562字中将是具有挑战性的。
- en: Now is the time to match the scene list with the word count of your book and
    target average word count of each chapter.

  zh: 现在是时候将场景列表与你的书的字数和每章的目标平均字数相匹配了。
- en: Scenes may need to be combined, condensed, or completely removed.  You might
    have better ideas about how you can introduce Jack, for example, to the reader
    in an engaging and empathetic way, that hooks the reader from page one. Perhaps
    we open with him observing a magical scene in a forest, and then immediately spot
    signs that poachers have been there? This would grab the reader and make them
    root for our Jack.

  zh: 场景可能需要合并、压缩或完全删除。也许你有更好的主意，比如如何以引人入胜和富有同情心的方式向读者介绍杰克，从而从第一页就吸引读者。也许我们可以以他观察到森林中的一个神奇场景开始，然后立即发现有偷猎者的迹象？这会吸引读者，并让他们为我们的杰克加油。

    into two or three scenes per chapter, supported by secondary characters and subplots.
