- en: While I must credit ChatGPT with some editing, polish, and even the occasional
    idea, the content and writing are my own. However, it is the great colleagues
    and mentors I’ve had in my education and career who truly deserve credit for the
    ideas in this book. I’m thankful to them and to the people who have continued
    to collaborate with me through writing this book. I’m grateful to several in particular
    for the time they invested in challenging and refining these ideas and inspiring
    creativity.

  zh: 虽然我必须感谢ChatGPT在一些编辑、润色甚至偶尔的想法上的帮助，但内容和写作都是我自己的。然而，真正应该得到这本书中想法认可的是我在教育和职业生涯中拥有的优秀同事和导师。我感谢他们，也感谢那些在写作这本书过程中继续与我合作的人。我特别感激一些人投入的时间，挑战和完善这些想法，激发创造力。
- en: We lost my dad in December 2022, about a week after ChatGPT was released. I’m
    sure he would have been amazed as both a technologist and educator. He’d routinely
    help me with my own writing, and rest assured that this book would have been significantly
    better if he were still with us. I’m grateful every day for my own “compound interest”
    that stemmed from his love, care, and support. This book is dedicated to his memory.

  zh: 我们在2022年12月失去了我父亲，大约是在ChatGPT发布后的一周。我相信作为一名技术专家和教育家，他一定会感到惊讶。他经常帮助我写作，可以肯定的是，如果他还在我们身边，这本书会更加出色。我每天都对自己从他的爱、关怀和支持中获得的“复利”感到感激。这本书是献给他的记忆。

- en: It is imperative that business leaders see these technologies in action and
    experience them firsthand, as it’s hard to develop a true appreciation for their
    immense power by merely reading about them. To facilitate this, we’ve placed several
    videos on our website that show ChatGPT in action and illustrate the examples
    outlined in this book. In addition, readers can find further information on generative
    AI and other related topics explored in this book, such as the Agile Strategy
    Framework.

  zh: 对于企业领导者来说，看到这些技术在实践中并亲身体验它们是至关重要的，仅仅通过阅读很难真正欣赏到它们巨大的力量。为了促进这一点，我们在我们的网站上放置了几个视频，展示了ChatGPT的运作方式，并说明了本书中概述的例子。此外，读者还可以在本书中探讨的生成式人工智能和其他相关主题上找到更多信息，比如敏捷战略框架。
