    because it’s more specific. This single event does not necessarily need to be
    tense, dramatic, or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting incident

    option is best for the character and (2) unable to put the book down, insistent
    on finding out what the character decides. Determining the intensity of the Choice
    is often a case of splitting hairs and not nearly as important as making sure
    the question facing the main character is a supremely difficult one. We are compelled
