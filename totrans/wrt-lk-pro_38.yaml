- en: In this example, the Storytelling technique is applied by using a narrative
    to describe a problem that the target audience faces “Once upon a time, there
    was a man who loved to travel but always struggled with finding comfortable and
    affordable accommodations.” The copy then introduces the solution “discovered
    our hotel booking app” and highlights the positive outcome “With its easy-to-use
    interface and extensive list of options, he was able to find the perfect place
    to stay every time.” The CTA “Join the happy traveler and try our app today” encourages
    the target audience to experience the same positive outcome for themselves.
