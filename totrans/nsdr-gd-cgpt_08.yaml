    answers, it is not always accurate. It may provide responses that, when fact-checked,
    turn out to be incorrect. It''s important to independently verify information
    and cross-check facts from reliable sources.'

    relies on the quality of the input data or questions provided. If the input is
    poorly worded or unclear, the generated response may be inadequate or unrelated
    to the intended query.'

    have the ability to search the internet for real-time information. Its responses
    are based on the knowledge it has acquired from training data and may not incorporate
    the latest updates or developments.'

    additional editing for clarity, correctness, or to incorporate personal stories
    or a preferred writing style. It may not produce content that matches the liveliness
    or preferred tone of human writers without additional editing.'

    duller style, which may not align with the preferences of all users or desired
    writing styles. Rewriting or editing may be necessary to infuse a livelier and
    more relaxed tone into the content.'
