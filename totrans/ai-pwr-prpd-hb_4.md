#### 提示 - 意大利菜：

Write a recipe for a traditional Italian dish using eggplant and ground beef
```

#### 输出 - 意大利菜

```
One traditional Italian dish that you can make using eggplant and ground beef is Eggplant and Beef Lasagna. Here's how to make it:

Ingredients:

1 large eggplant, thinly sliced
1 lb. of ground beef
2 cans of crushed tomatoes
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons of olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon of dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon of dried basil
12 lasagna noodles
2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion to the skillet and sauté until the onion becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, dried oregano, and dried basil to the skillet and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 20 minutes. While the sauce is simmering, prepare the eggplant by slicing it into thin rounds and sprinkling them with salt. Let them sit for 10 minutes to remove any excess moisture, then rinse and pat dry. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Assemble the lasagna by spreading a layer of the beef sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of the eggplant slices on top of the sauce, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the baking dish, finishing with a layer of beef sauce on top. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese on top of the lasagna. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This Eggplant and Beef Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is sure to impress. The combination of the eggplant, ground beef, and tomato sauce creates a hearty and flavorful filling, while the layers of lasagna noodles and cheese add a satisfying texture. This dish is perfect for a family dinner or a special occasion.
