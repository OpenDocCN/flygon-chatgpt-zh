- en: 'CHAPTER 5Ethical and professional use of ChatGPTThe burst of motivation you
    get from clicking “generate text” and seeing a perfectly written and structured
    paragraph immediately materialize on your screen is amazing. I know. The power
    of ChatGPT really seems like magic. But, as Spider-Man would say, “with great
    power comes great responsibility”. For this reason, this chapter is dedicated
    to the ethical professional use of ChatGPT in the world of writing.Let’s start
    by talking about transparency with your readers. Your readers trust you and you
    owe them your honesty. In the same way that you recognize the invaluable contribution
    of your editor, illustrator or translator, you should acknowledge the contribution
    AI has made to your work. Why? Because not only is honesty the best policy, but
    it’s the only one when it comes to professional writing.You don’t need to write
    “Written with ChatGPT” on the cover. It’s enough to put a simple nod in the credits,
    prologue or acknowledgements. I’m sure your readers will appreciate your transparency.
    They might even find the idea fascinating.Let’s look at responsibility. When you
    create stories with AI, it’s easy to let ChatGPT take the helm. But as an author,
    it’s your responsibility to guarantee the veracity of the information, ensure
    the content is aligned with your ethical and moral values, and generally maintain
    a high level of quality in your work. If you find errors in the text, false information,
    offensive or discriminatory content, or something that is simply out of step with
    your message, it’s your duty to review and correct it. Remember that you, and
    you alone, are the captain of your ship.Finally, let’s not forget about copyright
    and intellectual property. This is a delicate area, since the law cannot keep
    up with new technology.Although it’s very unlikely that ChatGPT will literally
    reproduce material protected by copyright, you should bear it in mind and make
    sure your book does not plagiarize, even partially, any previously published work.That
    said, content generated by ChatGPT tends to be considered new and unique, so you
    can claim it as your own. But remember, if in doubt, the best thing to do is seek
    legal advice.As a general rule: always respect others’ creative work, just as
    you would want your own work to be respected.In short, the use of AI in writing
    means entering uncharted territory, which requires a new type of responsibility
    on the part of writers. Being honest with your readers, taking creative responsibility
    and respecting copyright are fundamental aspects of this new era of AI-assisted
    writing.If you hold to these principles, you can make the most of this powerful
    technology without losing your integrity as an author. And that, dear writer,
    should be your ultimate objective.'
