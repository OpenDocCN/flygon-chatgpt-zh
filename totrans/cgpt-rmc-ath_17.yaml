    have “learnt” the style of popular books in your niche as part of learning how
    language patterns are constructed. It does not hold or recall specific sources
    or documents. It generates responses based on predicting what should come next
    in a piece of text, based on the patterns and structures it has learned during
    training.

    or plot elements in any of your prompts. It is very easy to ask ChatGPT to create
    a plot outline for a seven book YA Fantasy series set in a fantasy school for
    witchcraft and wizardry, featuring a young orphan hero like the one created by
    a certain J.K. Rowling.
