They are more conventional and suitable for small tasks. On the other hand, Plan-and-Execute Agents first decide a plan of actions to take, and then execute those actions one at a time.\nThought:Based on the observation, a langchain agent executor is an agent that decides and executes actions one step at a time, while a langchain execution plan is an agent that first decides a plan of actions and then executes them one at a time.\nFinal Answer: A langchain agent executor executes actions one step at a time, while a langchain execution plan first decides a plan of actions and then executes them.\n```", "```\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\nFollow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\n```", "```\nSo the final answer is: Muhammad Ali\n```"]
