    eventually deprioritise it and stop showing it to visitors.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sources”. ChatGPT would create something generic that sounds very “AI”.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    so that our blog posts will be unique and undetectable as AI generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we built on this with a name and brand guidelines, which were built on Part 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    - our content strategy and blog titles are based on the brand guidelines which
    in turn are based on prior work!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rewrite these parts. If possible make use this manual edit to really add some
    human spin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    up as likely to be AI generated. So I switched it out to “Sadly, it ain't that
    easy!” which passed with flying colours.
  prefs: []
