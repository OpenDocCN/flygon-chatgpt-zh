## 介绍由萨米开发的 FamilyGram 应用程序

萨米打算基于他已经创建的应用程序开展自己的业务。这款类似于 Instagram 的应用程序使用户可以拍照并与家人独家分享。它旨在通过与社交媒体平台保持分离为用户提供更高的隐私保护。该应用程序需要订阅费，但它保证父母和孩子他们的个人时刻将保持私密，并且只与他们亲近的人分享。他想将其命名为 FamilyGram。

现在应用程序已经开发并准备就绪，可以在 Android 和 iPhone 上运行，萨米不知道接下来该做什么，所以他问 ChatGPT 接下来的步骤是什么。

#### 提示 - 应用程序发布步骤：

```
Sami has developed an app called familygram. It runs on IOS and Android , what are the reccomended steps to launch this app as a viable profitable business
```

#### 输出 - 应用程序发布步骤

```
Launching an app as a viable and profitable business requires careful planning and execution. Here are some recommended steps that Sami can take to launch his app, Familygram:

Conduct market research: Sami needs to research the market to understand the competition, target audience, and potential demand for his app. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, and other market research methods. Develop a business plan: A business plan will help Sami define his goals, target audience, revenue model, and marketing strategies. It should also include financial projections, such as expected revenue and costs. Build a website and social media presence: Creating a website and social media profiles will help Sami promote his app and build a strong brand image. He can also use social media to engage with potential customers and gather feedback. Launch the app on app stores: Sami needs to list his app on the App Store and Google Play Store. This will require complying with their submission guidelines and paying any associated fees. Launch marketing campaigns: Sami needs to promote his app through digital marketing campaigns such as social media advertising, search engine optimization, and email marketing. He can also reach out to influencers or bloggers who specialize in family-related content. Continuously improve the app: Sami should gather feedback from customers and use it to improve the app's user experience. This can help attract new customers and retain existing ones. By following these steps, Sami can launch Familygram as a profitable business and grow it over time.
```

这需要考虑和做的事情很多，而萨米是一个优秀的编码人员，但在商业方面缺乏经验。ChatGPT 列出了以下步骤：

1.  进行市场调研

1.  制定商业计划

1.  建立网站和社交媒体存在

1.  在应用商店上发布应用程序

1.  推出营销活动

1.  持续改进应用程序。

是时候让萨米开始工作了，最好的方法是向 ChatGPT 寻求建议。

## 进行市场调研

在向 ChatGPT 提问时，最好将问题尽可能详细地提出，这样你就可以得到最适合你想要实现的答案。

让我们询问如何进行市场调研而不必花费很多钱。

#### 提示 - 市场调研：

```
I have developed an app   similar to Instagram, enables users to take photos and share them exclusively with family members. It is designed to provide greater privacy for its users by remaining separate from social media platforms. The app requires a subscription fee, but it guarantees parents and children that their personal moments will stay private and only shared with people close to them. He wants to call it FamilyGram. How do i conduct market research for my app familygram, that allows family to post private pictures and pay a fee for using the app. I have no budget and need a no cost or low cost method
```

#### 输出 - 市场调研

```
There are several ways to conduct market research for your app FamilyGram, even with a low or no budget. Here are some ideas:

Use social media: You can leverage social media to reach out to your target audience and conduct surveys or polls. You can post on Facebook groups, Twitter, or LinkedIn to ask questions about the types of features they would like to see in a family photo-sharing app, their willingness to pay a subscription fee, and their preferences for app design. Conduct customer interviews: You can reach out to friends, family members, and acquaintances who fit your target audience to conduct customer interviews. You can ask them questions about their photo-sharing habits, their opinions on existing photo-sharing apps, and their willingness to pay for a subscription-based app. Analyze competitor apps: Look at what other photo-sharing apps offer and read their reviews to understand what customers like and dislike about them. You can then use this information to develop features that will differentiate your app from the competition. Create a landing page: You can create a landing page for your app and use Google Analytics to track the number of visitors and the actions they take on the page. You can use this data to gauge interest in your app and understand which features are most appealing. Attend local events: You can attend local events such as family festivals or parenting workshops to conduct in-person surveys and get feedback from your target audience. Overall, it's important to be creative and resourceful when conducting market research with a limited budget. By leveraging free or low-cost tools, you can get valuable insights that will help you refine your app and make it more appealing to your target audience.
```

好的，这是一个很长的清单，但包含了很多有用的信息。让我要求一个待办事项摘要清单，这样我们就可以开始我们的市场调研之旅。

#### 提示 - 待办事项清单：

```
summarize in a todo list
```

#### 输出 - 待办事项清单

```
Sure! Here's a summary of the market research tasks you can do for FamilyGram, arranged in a to-do list format:

Use social media to conduct surveys or polls. Conduct customer interviews with friends, family members, and acquaintances who fit your target audience. Analyze competitor apps and their customer reviews. Create a landing page for your app and track visitors' actions using Google Analytics. Attend local events to conduct in-person surveys and get feedback from your target audience. Remember to keep track of your findings and use them to improve your app's features and design. Good luck with your market research!
```

萨米继续进行市场调研，并从他的目标受众那里得到了积极的反馈，他们都欣赏他的产品提供的隐私，并且开发者很容易就能接受任何建议或请求。

## 制定一个商业计划

萨米与潜在客户互动，并进行了所需的市场调研，更好地了解了他的应用程序以及人们在寻找什么。

现在他待办事项清单上的下一个任务是制定一个商业计划，问题是：萨米以前从未制定过商业计划。

再次，他请 AI 给他提出问题，以便他可以使他的商业计划更加有效和有用。

#### 提示 - 商业计划：

```

I want to develop a busines plan, what questions do i need to answer to help build a good busines plan
```

#### 输出 - 商业计划

```
To develop a business plan for your app, here are some key questions that you should consider:

What is the market opportunity for FamilyGram? Who is your target audience, and what are their needs? What is the competitive landscape? Who are your competitors, and what are their strengths and weaknesses? What is your unique value proposition? What sets FamilyGram apart from other photo-sharing apps, and how does it solve your target audience's problems? What is your pricing strategy? How much will you charge for subscriptions, and how does this compare to other photo-sharing apps? What is your marketing strategy? How will you promote FamilyGram to your target audience, and what channels will you use to reach them? What is your sales strategy? How will you acquire new subscribers, and what will your customer acquisition cost be? What is your operational plan? How will you manage the day-to-day operations of the business, and what resources will you need? What is your financial plan? How much revenue do you project to generate, and what are your expenses? What are your key performance indicators (KPIs), and how will you measure success? What are the risks and challenges that you anticipate, and how will you mitigate them? By answering these questions, you can develop a comprehensive business plan that will guide your app's development, marketing, and growth.

Business Plan for FamilyGram

Executive Summary:
FamilyGram is a social media platform that prioritizes privacy, providing families with a secure way to share photos and communicate with each other. Our target audience is families and extended families who value privacy and trust. Our app will offer a yearly subscription plan of $5 to ensure that our users' private information is not sold to third-party organizations. Market Opportunity:
The market for social media platforms is vast, with billions of active users worldwide. However, there is a growing concern among users about privacy and data security. Our unique value proposition of ensuring privacy and responsiveness to customer feedback differentiates us from other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Target Audience:
Our target audience is families and extended families. They need a social media platform that provides privacy and security, allowing them to share personal photos and communicate with each other. By providing a more secure and private platform, we aim to attract users who have concerns about their online privacy. Competitors:
Our primary competitors are Instagram and Facebook. While they offer social media platforms for users to share photos and communicate, privacy is not guaranteed. FamilyGram is committed to ensuring privacy and security, only sharing pictures with the intended audience, and using highly secure methods to guarantee privacy. Revenue Model:
FamilyGram will use a yearly subscription model of $5 per user. This subscription fee will be used to maintain the app's computing resources, ensure the app's independence, and ensure that users' private information is not sold to third-party organizations. Marketing Strategy:
Our marketing strategy will be based on referrals, where existing users will invite their family members to join. As the app grows, we will promote it in select markets and rely on the network effect to have the software spread. We will also use online advertising to target close-knit families and friends. Sales Strategy:
Initially, FamilyGram will acquire customers by word of mouth and referrals. To incentivize referrals, we will offer a 20% discount to the target customer and a 10% bonus to the referring customer. Operational Plan:
There will be a development team to maintain and update the app. We will also outsource the customer service email and chatbot to handle customer requests. A finance team will also be outsourced to keep track of all financial activities. Financial Plan:
Our primary financial goal is to achieve organic growth in the first three months of launch, followed by promoting the app in select markets. We will track our growth and revenue through several key performance indicators, including the number of users, revenue, user acquisition cost, support, and development cost, and miscellaneous cost. Risks and Challenges:
The primary risk is that the software may not spread as predicted. To mitigate this risk, we will work on more promotions and features to attract users. We will also prioritize customer feedback and respond promptly to their suggestions to ensure that our app remains competitive and meets users' needs. Conclusion:
FamilyGram aims to provide a social media platform that prioritizes privacy and security for families and extended families. By offering a more secure and private platform, we aim to attract users who have concerns about their online privacy. We believe that our unique value proposition, pricing strategy, and marketing approach will enable us to grow and succeed in the social media industry.

让我们也要求一些更详细的财务数据。

#### 提示 - 财务：

```
give me financials for the next 4 quarters, including a balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow. Make assumptions where needed and use industry figures when the information is not know
```

#### 输出 - 财务

```
I'm sorry, but it's not possible for me to generate specific financial projections without having detailed information about the business, including historical financial data and market analysis. Developing financial projections requires a thorough analysis of various factors such as the size of the target market, the competition, the pricing strategy, the marketing budget, the operational expenses, and many others.
```

随后是一些需要填写的空模板和表格。因此，我重新表述了具有数字预测的提示，特别是第一个提示响应中提到的要点。

#### 提示 - 具有数字假设的财务：

```
give me financials for the next 4 quarters, including a balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow. Make assumptions where needed and use industry figures when the information is not know
Assume $5 per user for an annual fee
Assume 30% growth per quarter. The first quarter will have 5000  users. Operations cost is 10% of revenue
Advertising is 15% of revenue
Acquistion cost is 10% of revenue
```

*结果是按季度综合的财务报表，包含所有细节，填满了几页。我将留给你作为一个练习来查看。*

*注意：有时 ChatGPT 在中途停止输出，只需在提示文本框中写“继续”。*

如果您不想深入了解业务计划部分，可以在这里停下，或者继续下面，我们请求资产负债表、利润和损失以及现金流量。

### 商业计划细节

或者，让我们将其分解成更小的部分，因此让我们修改提示如下

#### 提示 - 资产负债表：

```
Assume $5 per user for an annual fee
Assume 30% growth per quarter. The first quarter will have 5000  users. Operations cost is 10% of revenue
Advertising is 15% of revenue
Acquistion cost is 10% of revenue

I want a balance sheet for the next 4 quarters
```

#### 输出 - 资产负债表

```
Based on the given information, we can start by calculating the revenue and costs for each quarter, and then use those figures to construct a balance sheet. Quarter 1:

Starting Users: 5000
Annual Fee per User: $5
Revenue: 5000 * $5 = $25,000
Operations Cost: 10% of Revenue = $2,500
Advertising Cost: 15% of Revenue = $3,750
Acquisition Cost: 10% of Revenue = $2,500
Net Income: Revenue - Operations Cost - Advertising Cost - Acquisition Cost = $16,250
Using the 30% growth per quarter assumption, we can calculate the number of users for each subsequent quarter:

Quarter 2:

Starting Users: 5000 * 1.3 = 6,500
Annual Fee per User: $5
Revenue: 6,500 * $5 = $32,500
Operations Cost: 10% of Revenue = $3,250
Advertising Cost: 15% of Revenue = $4,875
Acquisition Cost: 10% of Revenue = $3,250
Net Income: Revenue - Operations Cost - Advertising Cost - Acquisition Cost = $21,125
Quarter 3:

Starting Users: 6,500 * 1.3 = 8,450
Annual Fee per User: $5
Revenue: 8,450 * $5 = $42,250
Operations Cost: 10% of Revenue = $4,225
Advertising Cost: 15% of Revenue = $6,338
Acquisition Cost: 10% of Revenue = $4,225
Net Income: Revenue - Operations Cost - Advertising Cost - Acquisition Cost = $27,462
Quarter 4:

Starting Users: 8,450 * 1.3 = 10,985
Annual Fee per User: $5
Revenue: 10,985 * $5 = $54,925
Operations Cost: 10% of Revenue = $5,493
Advertising Cost: 15% of Revenue = $8,239
Acquisition Cost: 10% of Revenue = $5,493
Net Income: Revenue - Operations Cost - Advertising Cost - Acquisition Cost = $35,700
Using these figures, we can construct a balance sheet for each quarter:

Quarter 1 Balance Sheet:

Assets		Liabilities & Equity	
$25,000	Equity	$25,000
Total	$25,000	Total	$25,000
Quarter 2 Balance Sheet:

Assets		Liabilities & Equity	
$57,500	Equity	$57,500
Total	$57,500	Total	$57,500
Quarter 3 Balance Sheet:

Assets		Liabilities & Equity	
$105,962	Equity	$105,962
Total	$105,962	Total	$105,962
Quarter 4 Balance Sheet:

Assets		Liabilities & Equity	
$163,337	Equity	$163,337
Total	$163,337	Total	$163,337
Note:

These balance sheets reflect the growth in assets (primarily cash from revenue) and equity (the owner's share of the business) over the four quarters, as well as the liabilities (none, in this case) that are owed by the business. It's worth noting that the assumptions made in this model may not reflect actual business performance. For example, 30% growth per quarter may be overly optimistic, while the percentages assigned to costs may not reflect real-world expenses. Additionally, the balance sheet does not account for additional factors such as taxes, interest on debt, or depreciation of assets. Nevertheless, this model can serve as a starting point for estimating the financial performance of a business over time.
