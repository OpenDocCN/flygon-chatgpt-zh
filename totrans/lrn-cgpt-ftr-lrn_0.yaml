- en: ChatGPT uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand
    and respond to input in a conversational context. At its core, ChatGPT is a large
    language model that was trained on a massive dataset of text. This training allows
    the model to understand the structure and meaning of language, and to generate
    responses that are appropriate and natural-sounding.
  prefs: []

    key ways. One of the most significant differences is the size of the model. ChatGPT
    is a large language model that was trained on a massive dataset of text, which
    gives it an unparalleled ability to generate human-like responses to input. In
    comparison, other language models and AI assistants are often trained on smaller
    datasets and are not able to generate responses with the same level of fluency
    and naturalness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important difference between ChatGPT and other language models and AI
    assistants is the type of input that it can handle. ChatGPT is designed to understand
    and respond to a wide range of conversational inputs, including both text and
    speech. In contrast, other language models and AI assistants are often more limited
    in their ability to process input, and may only be able to handle a single format
    (e.g. text only).
