    and how it will benefit your business. This will help you create more targeted
    and effective content. **Instead of asking “How to build a website that calculates
    Compound interest” ask - “Give me the code for an index.html page that has a compound
    interest calculator ”**'

    You never know, you might find a new way to generate content that you never thought
    of before. When creating content you can ask **“Write this in a witty, funny,
    engaging tone”** or you can even ask for **people** like **“Write this podcast
    introduction in the style of Joe Rogan”**'

    and captivating stories that can engage readers for long periods of time. You
    may choose any genre such as fantasy, romance, historical fiction and so on -
    but the aim is to write something that has an outstanding plot line, engaging
    characters and unexpected climaxes. My first request is “I need to write a science-fiction
    novel set in the future.”*'

    quite happy with it - you can click on the “Regenerate response” box - it’ll remove
    the existing output and create a whole new one'

    if you want to pick stuff like email subjects or video/blog titles, you’re unlikely
    to get one you LOVE on the first try, so you can ask chatGPT to generate 5,10
    or even 20 responses in one go.'

    content, it''s not a substitute for human editing. Take the time to review and
    refine the generated text to ensure it''s error-free and meets the needs of your
    business. You can even input existing text from anything to blogs or a book chapter
    or email to chatGPT and ask for “Give me Suggestions to improve this” and it’ll
    do it - you can focus on things like clarity, readability, and tone too.'
