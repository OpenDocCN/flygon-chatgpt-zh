- en: 'Post-publicationRemember that I told you Amazon allows you to place your book
    on presale up to a year before it’s published?I set the publication date to thirty
    days later.There are several good reasons for this, but the main reason is that
    a book should be looked over by a professional editor before being published.
    Always.It doesn’t matter whether you wrote it, ChatGPT wrote it, or Stephen King
    wrote it.I recommend that you look on Upwork, if you have time but a limited budget,
    or on  [The Urban Writers](https://soykevinalbert.com/tuw)[10](part0040.xhtml)
    if you want peace of mind and a fast, professional result.Of course, you can also
    use this extra time to give your book to your beta readers and get as much feedback
    as you can.Even though one of the great advantages of self-publishing on a platform
    like Amazon is that, if you find any mistakes or want to change something after
    you publish, you can do it immediately, that’s no excuse not to make the first
    version your readers receive the highest possible quality.Of course, you don’t
    have to go down the self-publishing route first; you can send your book to an
    editor first and publish it directly once they send it back to you with corrections.
    But…Why not make the most of those days to get your passive income machine rolling
    and start generating interest among readers?Note: I also used those thirty days
    to optimize the cover (making sure it aligned with the visual identity of my other
    books) using a Freelancer[11](part0041.xhtml) contest. Below, I will show you
    the first covers created by Bing Image Creator that I used for the launch. There
    were two of them: one for the Spanish-language version and one for the English-language
    version.![](image_rsrcXW.jpg)'
