- en: 'IntroductionThere I was, sitting for hours in front of my laptop, staring at
    a blank Word document. The words simply wouldn’t come. It was nothing new; call
    it writer’s block, call it lack of inspiration, call it- I don’t know- Monday…whatever.
    The point was that I was stuck.And mad.How could it be that there are robots that
    will clean your house from top to bottom, or drive a truck for hundreds of miles,
    but none that could help me to write a book? Even if it was just a little bit.At
    that moment, I could scarcely imagine what was around the corner. And it was going
    to rock the world.Welcome to a new reality! The reality of artificial intelligence
    (AI) and ChatGPT. A reality where, finally, machines can write a book. And not
    just a little bit.I’m not talking about hundreds of robots sitting in factory
    lines in front of typewriters. No, the truth is at once less dramatic and more
    revolutionary. When we talk about AI in the writing world, we’re talking about
    technology that can generate content, edit, correct and even help you sell your
    book. We’re talking about ChatGPT.Simply put, ChatGPT is an AI tool trained with
    a large quantity of information and designed to understand your questions and
    provide relevant, coherent answers. A virtual assistant you can ask questions,
    request help with different tasks or simply have a conversation.It''s like a super-journalist
    who can write at crazy speeds with a quality many can only dream of, and it doesn’t
    need to take a break to stretch its legs, see what there is in the refrigerator
    or check how many likes its latest insta post has received.And this is where a
    lot of people break out in a cold sweat. Does this mean that we writers are going
    to be replaced by this new technology?Personally, I don’t think so. At least,
    not yet.At the moment, ChatGPT has its shortcomings: it can give incorrect answers,
    it lacks creativity and subjectivity, its contextual understanding is limited
    and its knowledge is not up-to-date.But don’t underestimate its potential. Just
    think about AI as a puppy that needs to be trained. If you give it the right guidance
    and instructions, the possibilities are limitless. It’s up to us to teach it manners
    and stop it from biting the neighbors.You might be thinking: “Another tool to
    learn how to use? I don’t have it in me any more!”. But don’t worry – quite the
    opposite. On the one hand, to get the most out of ChatGPT, you don’t need to be
    a ChatGPT expert. Remember, it’s designed to understand you, and although you
    will probably get better at it with time and practice, you can take advantage
    of it from the first minute. On the other hand, ChatGPT will become a great ally
    for optimizing your time, taking care of the most tedious tasks and accelerating
    processes so you can devote your time to what really matters to you. Or to whatever
    you want. Netflix session while ChatGPT decides where the commas and apostrophes
    go? Why not?!I don’t believe that AI has come to put us out of a job. Not all
    of us, anyway. If we can adapt and make the best of it, it will help us improve
    our profession and in turn our quality of life. Think of it as your new writing
    assistant, like an enthusiastic intern who doesn’t need coffee or to figure out
    their work-life balance.So, whether you’re a bestselling author or aspiring to
    be one, or you simply like the idea of combining tech and writing…buckle up! You’re
    about to embark on an exciting journey where you’ll discover how artificial intelligence
    is going to change the world as we know it.We may have reached a point in history
    where writing well is no longer enough to triumph in the literary world. Maybe,
    as evolution has shown us for millions of years, it’s not the best person who
    prevails and wins the battle, but the one who best adapts to change.Don’t get
    left behind. Let’s go!'

  zh: 介绍我坐在电脑前几个小时，盯着一张空白的Word文档。文字就是无法流畅地表达出来。这并不是什么新鲜事；称之为写作障碍，称之为缺乏灵感，称之为- 我不知道-
    星期一……无论如何。关键是我被困住了。而且很生气。怎么可能有能够从头到尾清洁你的房子，或者开着卡车行驶数百英里的机器人，却没有一个能帮助我写书的？即使只是一点点。在那一刻，我几乎无法想象接下来会发生什么。而且它将会改变世界。欢迎来到一个新的现实！人工智能（AI）和ChatGPT的现实。一个现实，终于，机器可以写书。而且不只是一点点。我不是说的是数百个机器人坐在工厂生产线前面的打字机。不，事实既不那么戏剧性，又更加革命性。当我们谈论写作领域的AI时，我们谈论的是可以生成内容、编辑、校正甚至帮助你销售书籍的技术。我们谈论的是ChatGPT。简单来说，ChatGPT是一个经过大量信息训练的AI工具，旨在理解你的问题并提供相关的连贯答案。一个虚拟助手，你可以向它提问，请求帮助完成不同的任务，或者只是进行对话。就像一个超级记者，可以以疯狂的速度写作，质量让许多人只能梦寐以求，而且它不需要休息伸展腿，看看冰箱里有什么，或者查看它最新的ins帖子获得了多少赞。这就是许多人开始冷汗淋漓的地方。这是否意味着我们作家将被这种新技术取代？就我个人而言，我不这么认为。至少，还没有。目前，ChatGPT存在着缺陷：它可能会给出错误的答案，缺乏创造力和主观性，它的上下文理解能力有限，知识也不是最新的。但不要低估它的潜力。只需将AI视为需要训练的小狗。如果给它正确的指导和指令，那么可能性是无限的。我们需要教它礼貌，阻止它咬邻居。你可能会想：“又要学习如何使用另一个工具？我已经没有耐心了！”。但不用担心-
    恰恰相反。一方面，要充分利用ChatGPT，你不需要成为ChatGPT专家。记住，它被设计来理解你，虽然你可能随着时间和实践而变得更加熟练，但你可以从第一分钟开始利用它。另一方面，ChatGPT将成为优化你时间的强大盟友，照顾最繁琐的任务，加快流程，让你把时间专注于真正对你重要的事情。或者你想做什么。当ChatGPT决定逗号和撇号放在哪里时，为什么不看一集Netflix呢？我不认为AI来取代我们的工作。至少不是我们所有人。如果我们能够适应并充分利用它，它将帮助我们改善我们的职业，进而提高我们的生活质量。把它看作是你的新���作助手，就像一个热情的实习生，不需要咖啡，也不需要弄清楚他们的工作与生活的平衡。所以，无论你是畅销书作家还是渴望成为一名作家，或者你只是喜欢将技术和写作结合起来的想法……做好准备！你即将踏上一段激动人心的旅程，在这里你将发现人工智能将如何改变我们所知道的世界。也许我们已经到达了历史上一个写作好不再足以在文学界取得胜利的时刻。也许，正如演化向我们展示了数百万年一样，胜出并赢得战斗的不是最优秀的人，而是最能适应变化的人。不要被抛在后面。让我们开始吧！
