- en: ChatGPT can automate the quality control process by analyzing data and providing
    real-time feedback to machines. This technology can identify defects and irregularities
    in the production process, allowing manufacturers to make corrections before products
    are shipped to customers. ChatGPT can also provide insights into the root causes
    of defects, allowing manufacturers to make improvements to the production process.

- en: ChatGPT can automate inventory management by analyzing data and providing insights
    into inventory levels. This technology can predict demand for raw materials and
    finished products, allowing manufacturers to order materials and produce products
    in advance. ChatGPT can also identify potential bottlenecks in the production
    process, allowing manufacturers to take corrective action before they run out
    of critical materials.
