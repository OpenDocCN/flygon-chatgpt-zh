- en: The precipitous emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has set off a wave
    of transformations in the way that organizations work and how individuals engage
    with technology. These changes have been brought about by the rise of AI. One
    of the most impressive examples of artificial intelligence is known as ChatGPT,
    and it was developed by OpenAI. This model is capable of natural language processing.
    Because of its ability to read and generate language that is eerily similar to
    that of humans, it has the potential to make many aspects of business, especially
    the lucrative "make money" sector, an extremely confusing and unpredictably complex
    field.
