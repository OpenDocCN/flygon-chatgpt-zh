    aids that can help students prepare for exams, learn new vocabulary, or master
    key concepts. We will explore how ChatGPT can assist in creating study guides,
    building vocabulary lists, and making flashcards. These study aids are an excellent
    resource for students as they provide a quick and easy way to review and memorize
    information, allowing them to study more efficiently. Let’s see how ChatGPT can
    save you time and energy as you build support for your students.

- en: Wouldn’t it be great if you could quickly create a study guide for your students?
    Or better yet, wouldn’t it be great if your students could learn how to create
    their own? These often take a considerable amount of time to do from scratch.
    Fortunately, chatGPT makes the creation of study guides relatively easy. Throughout
    this book, I am sharing ideas you and your students can use to enhance learning.
    Create study guides by combining the ideas into a single document.
