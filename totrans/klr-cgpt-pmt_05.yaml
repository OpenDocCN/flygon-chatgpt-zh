    ChatGPT's power to complete that research more quickly. In this chapter, we'll
    look at how to prompt ChatGPT to summarize articles you might want to read, analyze
    data you've captured, and suggest topics connected to the topics you're researching.
    We'll also cover how to prompt ChatGPT to generate research questions for you
    and how to enlist ChatGPT's help to design experiments.

    need to study or to understand. But as your time is limited, you may want to get
    ChatGPT to summarize one or more articles for you. This can be a great way to
    get a quick overview of an article — enough, at least, to determine whether you
    should read the article yourself.

    number of key points, and a concluding paragraph.
