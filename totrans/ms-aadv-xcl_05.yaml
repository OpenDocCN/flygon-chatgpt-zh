    other words, you can say that you want to restrict the user to enter certain type
    of values in the cell. Data Validation does this work for you.

- en: The Data Validation is a process which prevents the users from entering invalid
    data for individual cells or cell range. With the help of data validation, you
    can limit the data entry to a specific data type, like integer numbers, fractional
    (decimal) number or text. You can also set the limit on valid entries.

    based on the number of units sold and the price per unit. The formula for the
    total revenue is simply the product of the number of units sold and the price
    per unit. In this example, cell C2 contains the formula for the total revenue,
    which is “=A2*B2”. Cell A2 contains the number of units sold, and cell B2 contains
    the price per unit.
