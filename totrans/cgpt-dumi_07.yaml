    as it was available for public use at the whopping cost of free, it became a hit
    with humans working in a variety of disciplines. But amid the excitement was a
    touch of unease as workers wondered whether this AI model was the one that would
    replace them. From fear, excitement, or a mix of both, nearly everyone was eager
    to see what it could do.

    and competitors sprang into being nearly overnight. More than 200 such tools were
    released in a single week, and the flow of releases hasn’t slowed. However, it
    was clear from the start that OpenAI’s ChatGPT and underlying GPT models are the

    stripe and in several disciplines, including but not limited to developers of
    business and consumer apps. Because ChatGPT puts programming well within the reach
    of newbies too, separating its professional and consumer uses is difficult. More
    uses will come to light over time — and your own imagination may lead you to new

    applications to assist people at work. ChatGPT can be found in the form of extensions
    and plug-ins as well as embedded or integrated in general work applications and
    specialized tools. Although GPT is an acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer,
    a type of AI large language model, some people jokingly say it means “general-purpose
    tool” because of its versatility. You’re about to see how versatile and prevalent
    it really is.

    no surprise that Microsoft products were among the first to incorporate ChatGPT.
    For example, Microsoft’s Copilot, which is now infused with GPT-4 and called GitHub
    Copilot X, is essentially ChatGPT fine-tuned for developers. Although Copilot
    was designed as a developer's tool, its versatility was soon leveraged to create
    Microsoft 365 Copilot for more generalized use and embedded in Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
    Outlook, Teams, and other Microsoft applications.

    Microsoft 365 apps and your data, including your calendar, emails and chats, documents,

    model for your organization by making the data easily accessible to and sharable
    with others in the organization. This more inclusive knowledge model helps prevent
    the loss of institutional memory when workers leave the company and take their
    know-how and knowledge of customers, deals, project status, company history, and

    Copilot will continue to suggest one line of code after another until you’ve pretty
    much written a program. But — and there’s always a but, isn’t there? — Copilot
