    is to utilize the model to produce regular language questions or explanations
    that are connected with the job needing to be done. For instance, in the event
    that the objective is to prepare a chatbot to give client service to a particular
    item, ChatGPT can be utilized to create a rundown of inquiries that clients could
    pose to about the item, for example, "What are the item's elements?" or "How would
    I investigate an issue with the item?"

    intended to get specific kinds of reactions. For instance, assuming that the objective
    is to prepare a model to perceive opinion in text, ChatGPT can be utilized to
    create prompts that contain particular kinds of words or expressions that are
    probably going to get close to home reactions from individuals, for example, "I
    feel blissful when..." or "It makes me miserable when...".
