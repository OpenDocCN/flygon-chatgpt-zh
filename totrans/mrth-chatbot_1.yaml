- en: The latest achievements in the field of *artificial intelligence* (AI) pose
    many challenges to society. For the broad public, including researchers and professionals
    from domains outside of AI, the border between what is the technically possible
    and science fiction is getting blurrier.

    interpretations, and the conflation of these leads to exaggerated expectations

- en: The main approach behind the technologies referred to as artificial intelligence
    nowadays is *machine learning* (*ML*). Machine learning enables a computer to
    learn from examples for the purpose of solving tasks on similar data that it has
    not seen before. Although the foundations of machine learning date back to the
    1960s, high computational and data demands relegated it to more of a side curiosity
    in the field of computer science for several decades. This changed in the new
    millennium, as the power of computer hardware and the advent of big data (the
    examples the computer learns from) culminated to the point that ML began to achieve
    impressive results. Machine learning can be applied in different fields, and the
    examples from which the computer learns can be of different data types, such as
    images, texts, videos, or a conventional data table.

    computers and human language, including the development of methods for the automatic
    analysis or generation of text. Different methods have been employed in the past
    to achieve this, and nowadays, this sort of processing benefits leans heavily
    on advances in machine learning. The meeting of machine learning and NLP has given
    rise to language models, as illustrated in Fig. [1.1](#Fig1). These are statistical
    models that aim to describe patterns in written language and can be used, among
    other things, for text generation. Language models are what’s behind the curtain
    in some of the latest hyped products, including ChatGPT.![](../images/604345_1_En_1_Chapter/604345_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: The topic of artificial intelligence has been ubiquitous in the broad media
    over the last few years. In particular, *generative AI* received a great deal
    of attention (and some notoriety) as an example of the capacity for machine learning-based
    software to generate (fake) images. Language models (which can be seen as generative
    AI for text) have only recently been covered in more detail since late 2022 with
    the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI.

- en: ChatGPT is a conversational chatbot that provides human-like answers to user-written
    prompts and can do so in several languages. Its responses can seem sound and eloquent
    and are superficially very plausible, but upon closer inspection, it turns out
    that the answers can contain incorrect or misleading information. For example,
    it is known to create references to imaginary law texts or books.

    2022, the capabilities of ChatGPT seemed impressive, yet not surprising, the broad
    public was impressed – and frightened. Reactions ranged from sensing real emotions
    and consciousness in the answers of ChatGPT to fear of job loss and students cheating
    on exams. Perhaps it was because this was the first time that a language model
    was made easily accessible to the general public?

    To take an active role in this process, the broad public needs to be included
    in the discourse and steer, along with politicians, scientists, engineers, and
    practitioners, the digital society of the future toward the responsible and reasonable
    use of new technologies in the field of artificial intelligence. To be able to
    participate in this discussion, the public needs to understand the technical basics
    underlying these technologies. Only such an understanding allows a measured assessment
    of what is realistically possible with them, what are the limitations, and what
    is only science fiction. That is why I decided to write this book. As a data engineer
    and researcher in applied machine intelligence with a technical background in
    computer science, I am interested in how the responsible use of AI technology
    can be achieved. This requires dialogue with the general public. In this book,
    I want to give the non-technical reader a better understanding of how language
    models (such as the one ChatGPT is based upon) work, their amazing capabilities,
    and their limitations.

- en: Whereas these technologies are becoming omnipresent in research, work environments,
    and society, the general public still has too little literacy regarding them.
    In the interdisciplinary research projects on which I have collaborated as a technical
    partner, a basic understanding of the technical concepts for the non-technical
    project partners has proven to be essential. Achieving such an understanding can
    be time-consuming and sometimes difficult, as different working cultures meet
    and communicate. However, I have experienced a great appreciation for technical
    explanations of new technologies in non-technical language. The fact that my project
    partners found my explanations valuable inspired me to write this book.

- en: I have written this book to provide the broad public the necessary background
    information about text analysis and text generation to be able to sensibly participate
    in the public discourse of how and under which conditions the use of AI technologies
    is acceptable. This technology has the potential to radically affect our life,
    work, and education in the long term. For example, essays, articles, and advertisement
    slogans can all be generated and customized for a specific target audience. Translating
    technical concepts into visual slides and comprehensive explanations for my computer
    science students is already challenging, and explaining these contents for a broad
    public is even more so. Yet, it is of the utmost importance in today’s world to
    make accessible explanations available, and I see it as our task as technical
    researchers to do so.

    chapters. The book is aimed for a general audience, explaining mathematical or
    technical background as necessary. Therefore, the book will of course not be able
    to fully cover the entirety of either machine learning or natural language processing.
    I will however refer to more technical computer science textbooks and literature

    machine learning. Often, yet not always, when we talk about artificial intelligence,
    we are really talking about methods from machine learning. This is especially
    the case with recent breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing:
    the language models that we will discuss in later chapters. This introduction
    to machine learning will therefore give you the foundations. I will explain the
    different subdomains of machine learning, as well as how it differs from traditional
    software.'

- en: Then, in Chap. [3](604345_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml), I will dive deeper into the
    topic of natural language processing. Written language can express much more than
    the content of the words included in a sentence. Different methods have been developed
    to process written language or generate humanlike texts. This chapter gives an
    overview of these methodologies and indicates use cases that benefit from these
    technologies. You will also go one step further in your machine learning knowledge.
    Example by example, you will get a closer look at how the learning process actually
    happens, and I will introduce the concepts of neural networks and deep learning.
    Finally, this foundation will support the introduction of the concept of word
    embeddings, which allows computers (which prefer numbers over words) to process
    words from human languages.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Chap. [4](604345_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml), I will go from word embeddings to
    the state-of-the-art language models that build the foundation for the latest
    technological advances, including the societal questions their existence brings
    forth. As language models get more sophisticated, they create the illusion of
    a system with true humanlike understanding. Do they really have a sentient, conscious
    thought process? In the public discussion around ChatGPT, this is a regular question.
    I will therefore explore in detail the inner workings of transformer-based language
    models and expose how they are much more related to statistical probabilities
    than humanlike emotions. Furthermore, I will discuss the human side of the conversation.
    I will explain, for example, why humans respond differently to the answers provided
    by a chatbot than to a list of results from a search engine.

    generated by novel text generation technologies do mostly look plausible at first
    glance, they might contain misinformation. This chapter discusses why this happens
    and how it is not necessarily the primary aim of text generation technology to
    be fully correct in the content it produces. Connecting to the technical descriptions
    from Chaps. [3](604345_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml) and [4](604345_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    this chapter illustrates how such misinformation, for example, in the form of
    hallucinations, is generated, how difficult it is to technically address the problem,
    and the challenges that arise from this. Additionally, a short introduction to
    the history of chatbots is provided, and you will learn some common performance
    metrics used to assess machine learning models.

    are encoded into language models. Connecting to the technical explanations of
    word embeddings from Chap. [3](604345_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml) and the transformer-based
    models in Chap. [4](604345_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml) and using concrete examples,
    this chapter introduces you to the problem of bias in natural language processing.
    It is furthermore discussed how this bias encoded in the language model can lead
    to the generation of discriminatory recommendations and texts. Finally, we will
    look at other limitations and risks of large language models such as the use case
    and ecological aspects.

- en: Finally, in Chap. [7](604345_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml), I will further discuss the
    societal consequences of all of this. The rise of AI technologies suggests many
    questions regarding the collaboration of humans and smart technologies in the
    future, with the potential to impact the way we learn, teach, and work. In particular,
    the focus of this chapter lies on the future need for collaboration between humans
    and bots powered by language models. Given the limitations discussed in the other
    chapters, I will introduce the concept of augmented intelligence, empowering humans
    rather than replacing them. This changes the way some jobs will be executed but
    enables human control over potentially biased or false outcomes of applications
    based on language models. I will argue that, rather than fully excluding AI technology,
    we must integrate it in our working and learning environments in a responsible
    way.
