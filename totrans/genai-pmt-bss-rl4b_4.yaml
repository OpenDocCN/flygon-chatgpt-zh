- en: 'HOW GENERATIVE AI WORKSAI research initially focused on using algorithms and
    neural networks to recognize patterns in large data sets. This is used for pattern
    recognition, analytics, decision support, and anomaly detection. A neural network
    is a digital representation of the human brain designed to simulate the natural
    systems of thought. Such a network has input, and output layers of neurons, with
    one or more layers, called hidden layers.INPUT AND OUTPUT LAYER TO GENERATE AIIn
    simple terms, you activate an input neuron for each unit of data (e.g., word).
    So, for example, inputting the phrase "blazing sun" into a neural network will
    activate three input neurons red, hot, and Sunday. Then, in the output layer,
    you let it know that these three inputs mean "blazing sun. "At first, this might
    seem silly and time-consuming, but after you use "blazing hot sun," "green hot
    sun, "cool green sun," and "cool yellow sun, "then it starts to understand what
    hot, dark green, and cold might be.This is a very simplified explanation. But
    while neural networks are complex concepts, their study has been a fantastic journey
    into the world of artificial intelligence and the human mind and consciousness.Furthermore,
    over the years, neural network technologies have evolved into new systems and
    platforms that enable today''s generative AI applications. Here are three popular
    neural networks used:'

- en: Generative Adversarial Network (Gan) â€“ This neural network uses two parts to
    generate an output. The first part is the generator that produces unexpected results,
    while the second part is the discriminator, which evaluates the work to see if
    it's real or fake. GANs use an unsupervised learning system, meaning the discriminator
    part teaches the generator. Over time, the discriminator improves at detecting
    fakes, while the generator learns to produce better output to realistic pictures.

- en: Transformer:This type of neural network stores any data sequence in another
    sequence, which a decoder can then use to reproduce the original data sequence.
    Transformers are best suited for projects with sequential data, such as natural
    language sentences and music. Popular Transformer-based neural networks include
    Microsoft's GPT-3, Beijing, China's Budao 2.0, and Google's LaMDA.

    noise in images, draw images, reduce the size, and classify and detect objects.
    VAE models use unsupervised learning methods to shrink data files using compression
