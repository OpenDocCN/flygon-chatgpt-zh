  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT works differently than a search engine. A search engine such as Google
    or Bing or an AI assistant such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant works by searching
    the internet for matches to the keywords you enter in the search bar. Algorithms
    refine the results based on any number of factors, but your browser history, topic
    interests, purchase data, and location data usually figure into the equation.

    offer citations or note its sources. You ask; it answers. Easy-peasey, right?

    impressive.

    the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) or GPT-4 model to analyze the
    prompt with context and predict the words that are likely to follow. Both GPT
    models are extremely powerful large language models capable of processing billions
    of words per second.

    a response to a prompt. ChatGPT creates a response by considering context and
    assigning weight (values) to words that are likely to follow the words in the
    prompt to predict which words would be an appropriate response.

    and GPT-4 are large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI. When GPT-3 was
    introduced, it was the largest LLM at 175 billion parameters. An upgraded version
    called GPT-3.5 turbo is a highly optimized and more stable version of GPT-3 that's
    ten times cheaper for developers to use. ChatGPT is now also available on GPT-4,
    which is a multimodal model, meaning it accepts both image and text inputs although
    its outputs are text only. It's now the largest LLM to date, although GPT-4’s
    exact number of parameters has yet to be disclosed.

    and layers in the neural network architecture. The more parameters a model has,
    the more complex its internal representations and weighting. In general, more
    parameters lead to better performance on specific tasks. For example, ChatGPT’s
    large number of parameters enables it to understand subtle nuances and context
    complexities in a wide range of natural-language-processing tasks. As a result,
    it appears to have the capacity for instantaneous reasoning as it converses fluently
    with users.

    model, held the record at 17 billion parameters. GPT-4 is currently the biggest
    neural network created. GPT-5 is rumored to be even bigger, but it currently isn’t
    being trained. Some AI experts argue that there is no reason to train an even
    larger model because GPT-4 is so huge it will serve for years to come. I agree
    that there’s no reason to rush GPT-5 to fruition given that users and developers
    have barely scratched the surface of what GPT-4 can do.

    prompts. A transformer is a type of neural network architecture. In AI, a neural
    network is a network of processing nodes that use a set of algorithms to mimic
    the human brain. You can think of nodes in an AI brain as working like neurons
    in a human brain.

    in 2017 and were initially designed to handle translations for which context,
    not word order, was more crucial to delivering a corresponding meaning in another
    language. But transformers proved to be a cornerstone for much more complex language-processing
    tasks too. The big advantage of transformers is that they can be efficiently parallelized,
    meaning they can scale to handle exceptionally large AI models and their training
    requirements.

    truth is fact and fact is reality, but imagination is separate, or at best tangential,

    you want it to do that because you want its response to be crafted in a creative
    manner or to include an innovative idea. But other times the response ChatGPT
    delivers is flat-out wrong, perhaps even offensive. Remember that ChatGPT is predicting
    which words will follow your prompt, fulfill your intent, and adhere to the context
    in the prompt. When it predicts — or guesses — incorrectly but has determined

  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On March 1, 2023, OpenAI launched an application programming interface (API),
    which is a connector of sorts that lets applications communicate with each other.
    The API makes it easier for developers to integrate ChatGPT with their organization’s
    products, services, apps, and websites. The price at introduction was $0.002 per
    1000 tokens. That’s relatively cheap as AI price tags go, making ChatGPT easily
    accessible for most developers from a cost standpoint.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is the API priced in units of tokens? ChatGPT models consume a sequence
    of messages with metadata attached in a raw format called Chat Markup Language
    (ChatML). Traditionally, GPT models consume raw, unstructured text as tokens.
    So it’s no surprise that inputs for ChatGPT models are rendered as a sequence
    of tokens, each containing pieces of words.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens are used to predict the next token and the next and — voila! — a machine-generated
    narrative occurs. As you may have noticed, this process is not thinking as humans
    describe the brain-driven process. This process also predicts text in a far faster,
    more intelligent, and multitasked way than simple predictive text or the autocorrect
    feature on your smartphone or in a document spell-checker.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a side note, the predictive nature of GPT problem-solving creates the weird
    issue of too many fingers on human hands in GPT-generated images. The GPT image
    model sees that one finger follows another on a human hand but often fails to
    note that the number of fingers is limited to five and that the fingers are not
    identical. Hence, it typically predicts more fingers and draws them oddly. If
    the GPT models could truly think, even at a child’s level, they could detect the
    problem and put the correct number of fingers on a hand — in every image containing
    normal human hands.

    too. Fiction writers can use it to generate story ideas, plots, and characters.
    Non-fiction writers can use it make first drafts of articles, white papers, e-books,
    and more — in the writer’s personal writing style and tone. Then the writer need
    only fact-check and tweak the output to produce a quick but polished draft suitable
    for submission. Or writers can use ChatGPT to serve as an editor to make the copy
    cleaner before submitting it to a human editor or a publisher. And no, ChatGPT
