- en: ChatGPT is a global phenomenon that sparks fear and excitement worldwide. Because
    it sounds human but is made of advanced AI software connected to an internet-sized
    database, people assume that it's better — or worse — than humans.

    lore. Maybe it will save mankind. Perhaps it will take all our jobs and eliminate
    our purpose for living. Maybe it will make everything cheap and banish inflation.

    — notwithstanding a scary or offensive machine rant or hallucination or two.

- en: To give ChatGPT’s seemingly sudden appearance in the world some much-needed
    perspective, think back to past cycles when a new technology was assumed to be
    the end of a previous one. The advent of radio was going to eradicate newspapers.
    TV was thought to be a radio slayer. And the internet was supposed to be the TV
    killer. But that’s not what happened. Although these forms of communication have
    changed over the years, they all co-exist.

- en: ChatGPT is yet another communication medium. It generates narratives in a conversational
    format. But just like the communication media that came earlier — newspaper, radio,
    TV, and the internet — ChatGPT isn’t going to replace much that came before. It
    certainly isn’t going to replace search engines. Each serves a distinct purpose
    the other can't recreate — although at some point, the two technologies might
    converge.

- en: ChatGPT isn’t going to replace people in their jobs, either. Rather, it will
    eliminate some jobs and create others. This is a cycle you’ve seen more than once.
    For example, both the invention of the assembly line and modern-day automation
    replaced some workers but also created jobs. ChatGPT will eventually spark a similar
    job cycle.

- en: ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can assist humans in doing many different kinds
    of work. And when its use is coupled with something capable of a physical manifestation,
    such as 3D printers or automated physical infrastructure, the effect in the real
    world can be astonishing. Workers who become adept at using it to increase their
    own productivity and creativity will be best positioned to advance in their existing
    careers or move to new ones.

- en: If what I’ve written so far seems reassuring, you're mistaken. ChatGPT is an
    existential technology, a hard pivot in human experience, and a doorway to a far
    different kind of future. It's the harbinger of the AI Age and a pronounced mark
    of the arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If that terrifies you, you're
    still mistaken.

    forms mostly mirrors that duality. ChatGPT certainly does.

- en: The most threatening aspect of ChatGPT is its capability to rapidly create and
    spread harmful disinformation in every aspect of human life, from politics to
    healthcare and everything in-between. It can lie, hallucinate, misinform, and
    make stuff up. How human of it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most endearing aspect is its capability to help people create things that
    do not yet exist. ChatGPT can help authors and scriptwriters create stories, filmmakers
    make incredible special effects and new films on the tiniest of budgets, performance
    artists consider new routines, musicians create new scores, architects design
    new kinds of buildings, and photographers capture realistic images of decidedly
    unreal subjects. No aspect of human creativity is beyond the scope of ChatGPT’s
    enhancement and collaborative capabilities.

- en: Can ChatGPT be used to outright replace the work of creative people? Yes, it
    can. Note that publishers’ inboxes and self-publishing platforms are already filled
    to the brim with ChatGPT-generated books. But also note that most of them are
    truly awful reads.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who jumped to create works using only ChatGPT were driven by greed,
    not by any desire to create true art. It takes a true artist to shape a prompt
    for ChatGPT that will render a magnificently original creative work.

- en: The lack of quality coupled with recent events in the US that deny copyright
    protection of such works — while enforcing copyright protections for any plagiarism
    ChatGPT and its ilk use in the creation of such works — will soon rob the greedy
    of their dreams of easy wealth.

- en: And like the content farms of yesteryear that tried to game search engines by
    producing godawful reads full of keywords, those using ChatGPT to create fast
    content for cash will soon fall into obscurity.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But do remember that the fatal fall for content farms came from human hands,
    in spite of the intense efforts at search engine optimization (SEO). Specifically,
    owners of search engines didn’t want to render lists of trash results to users,
    so they drove the work of content farms to the far outer corners of the search
    universe. Mainstream media, seemingly on its last leg and hemorrhaging badly,
    began to rebound almost immediately.
  prefs:

    experts will continue to thrive, with ChatGPT taking a permanent place as an important
    tool in their toolbox.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same will likely hold true for most knowledge workers. Using ChatGPT in
    place of or without the direct supervision of workers who possess the necessary
    knowledge will prove to be a horrendous and expensive mistake. Such careless reliance
    on ChatGPT alone will also open companies to a slew of liabilities while producing
    little in the way of efficiencies or revenue.

- en: Public trust will be further eroded. Generative AI can produce fake voice tracts
    that are identical to the original voice, provide tons of disinformation on nearly
    every subject, and manipulate human behavior through carefully formed narratives.
    It will be much harder for citizens in any country to discern reality from deception
    and truth from untruth. Even the results of fact-checking will be suspicious given
    that generative AI can mimic trustworthy sources. Security teams will be pushed
    to the limit to keep pace. Fortunately, AI models can be trained to help spot
    and stop these threats. Unfortunately, it’ll take much longer to rebuild public
    trust.

    AI to make them faster and better at performing tasks requiring immense amounts
    of information. But ChatGPT can be considered a superapp in that it can do tasks
    that formerly required several separate apps, and it can do so by automatically
    selecting plug-ins to augment its own performance as needed.

- en: ChatGPT integrations will eventually be replaced with connected AI. Chat GPT
    is being integrated with search engines, apps, and other technologies that may
    or may not have other AI embedded or integrated. Soon, various forms of AI will
    be connected directly rather than indirectly through app integrations. Some think
    this is the path to the infamous singularity, while others see it as little different
    than integrating multiple apps.

    smart TVs, smart things of all kinds will become more helpful as virtual assistants
    like Siri and Alexa become supercharged with generative AI capable of understanding
    and even anticipating user needs.

- en: Knowledge work will be augmented. Workers will spend less time handling mundane
    functions in knowledge work and more time focused on creating more knowledge.
    For example, data analysts can use ChatGPT to do the needed analysis as well as
    write final reports. This will free data analysts to look deeper into the data
    for more refined insights and to unearth knowledge that may have been missed earlier.
    Likewise, lawyers can use ChatGPT to write legal briefs, contracts, and other
    legal documents. The signers can use ChatGPT to condense all the legal forms into
    an easy-to-understand summary. Opposing attorneys can do likewise, and thus free
    their time to develop a strategy to counter any challenges or sticking points
    that ChatGPT uncovers in evidence or legal agreements.

    cycle. Because companies seek to stay ahead of emerging trends and be the first-to-market
    on new ideas, marketers and advertisers will use ChatGPT and its siblings to produce
    content and ads extremely fast to sell in the moment. As the product changes with
    the moment, so too will the ads.

    know it will be disrupted by ChatGPT and generative AI of all forms. The nine-month
    education model designed to let farmer’s children out of school for planting and
    harvesting is no longer needed or useful. Neither is the mass conveyor-belt-like
    grade system or formalized testing. ChatGPT will enable educators to move to more
    customized learning models wherein students progress according to their competency
    with the subject rather than their age, school grade, or time spent on the subject
    matter. How can it do that? By enabling educators to analyze each student’s data
    and create a customized learning plan for each student. Homework, tests, and other
    measures of subject competence can also be assessed and reported by generative
    AI.

    reporting. That task requires human reporters to find hidden information and conduct
    interviews. However, ChatGPT can help fill in the background info for color and
    context and get the final piece to audiences faster. Journalists will be valued
    more for their ability to dig up or create additional insights rather than for
    simply reporting existing and often easily found facts.

    can discuss issues with customers, offer solutions, give instructions in product
    support, facilitate returns that fit the customer’s circumstances, and resolve
    issues faster and with less friction than typical customer service processes.
    For example, instead of a shopper searching a company's website for a given product,
    ChatGPT can become a personal shopper and deliver product selections that fit
    the taste, size, and style preferences of each individual shopper.

    latest research and recommendations based on the probability of success for a
    specific patient. ChatGPT can act as a physician’s assistant in other ways too.
    In addition, ChatGPT can save lives by providing information for laypeople to
    help them prevent health issues, deliver emergency treatment, and accurately assess
    whether a doctor’s attention is warranted.
