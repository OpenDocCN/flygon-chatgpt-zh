  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens are the language puzzle pieces that AI models like ChatGPT use to comprehend
    and generate text. However, tokens aren't uniform in size – they can range from
    entire words to single characters or even smaller units. This distinction is crucial
    because tokens play a key role in determining the model's capacity and the length
    of your interactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In essence, a token limit sets the boundary for how much information can be
    processed in a single exchange with ChatGPT. Both the input tokens (those in your
    prompts) and output tokens (in ChatGPT's responses) count toward this limit. If
    a prompt or response exceeds the token limit, it might get truncated or cut off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you request a response of 100 tokens, it won't necessarily translate
    to 100 words or 100 letters. Tokens can be a full word like "apple," a single
    letter like "a," or even a punctuation mark like "!". So, the token count doesn't
    directly equate to a specific word or character count.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To give you an estimate, about 100 tokens could result in roughly 15-20 words,
    but this can fluctuate based on the language's complexity and context. Understanding
    this concept empowers you to craft prompts and responses that fit within the token
    limit, ensuring you receive the most comprehensive and accurate results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens have a significant role in the context of model capacity. A token limit
    defines the maximum amount of text a model can handle in a single interaction.
    If a prompt exceeds this limit, you might receive a truncated or incomplete response.
    Both input and output tokens count toward this limit.
  prefs: []

    to ChatGPT. Longer prompts consume more input tokens.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    detailed responses use up more output tokens.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    if you use a long prompt, the available tokens for generating a response might
    be limited, affecting the depth and breadth of the answer.
