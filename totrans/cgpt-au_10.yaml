- en: Stay focusedDon’t you find it strange that we’re almost at the end of our book
    and I haven’t said anything about plugins, extensions or the best prompts for
    writers? I mean, I haven’t even told you if I used ChatGPT 3.5 or 4 to create
    this book.Did I forget? No. Simply put, it’s not necessary. This book is not about
    that.Let me explain.My intention with this book was never to turn you into a ChatGPT
    expert. It was quite the opposite. The aim was to show you that you DON’T need
    to be a ChatGPT expert in order to make the most of its amazing potential and
    help you overcome your fear of this new and revolutionary technology.That’s why
    I didn’t want to use any external “accessories”. And even though I have access
    to ChatGPT 4, I used ChatGPT 3.5 for this book – and it’s free.Would it be possible
    to get even better results or write a book in even less time if you used plugins
    or external extensions? I have no doubt that it would. Is it necessary? No.Don’t
    lose sight of your ultimate objective. And I imagine that, since you’re reading
    this book and not a different one, it’s because your aim is not “just” to write
    more and better, but to achieve financial freedom thanks to your books. In other
    words, to escape the rat race:![](image_rsrcXX.jpg)For this, you don’t need to
    be a ChatGPT expert. Writing a book in five minutes or five hours is not going
    to make the difference. What really is going to make the difference is your ability
    to spring into action. Remember, taking action is the only secret.I hope this
    book has contributed to giving you that little push that we often need to get
    going.That was the goal.
