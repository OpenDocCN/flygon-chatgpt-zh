- en: We are the human authors of this book on the evolution of communication and
    creativity from cave paintings to AI. However, the writing process for this book
    was quite unique as we utilized ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
    language model, to assist us in writing the content.

- en: We provided ChatGPT with various prompts and ideas, and it then generated text
    based on those inputs. While the majority of the text in this book was generated
    by ChatGPT, we did review and edit the content to ensure it met our standards
    and accurately conveyed the information we wanted to convey.

    has not edited our writing, possibly to the detriment of the quality of the writing!
