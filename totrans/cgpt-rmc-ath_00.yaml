    become fascinated by the power of story craft and author-preneurship in genre
    commercial fiction.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First.  Romance fiction is still one of the most popular forms of genre fiction.
    From historical to contemporary, from classic Cinderella tropes to same-gender
    romance, paranormal to small-town Western romance, readers have a passion for
    niche romance fiction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This wide variety of niche subcategories in the romance genre means that there
    are readers online at this moment looking for precisely the kind of romance that
    you love to read and are planning to write. That’s the good news! There is a market
    for your niche romance, no matter how small.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly. Commercial romance fiction has developed unwritten story conventions,
    tropes, and elements that today’s readers will both recognize and expect to see
    in modern romance fiction such as novellas and novels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you love reading and writing romances in a particular niche, you will already
    be familiar with many of these tropes and themes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A paranormal, fantasy or historical romance will have different story conventions
    to a small-town western, or a modern big-city romantic comedy, for example. A
    romance author has to weave those elements into their story craft as part of story
    development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So. You love reading and writing romances that serve a particular book category
    where there is already a hungry audience for readers in that niche and understand
    the tropes implicit in writing for that niche. Brilliant!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now we get to the issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thirdly.  In order to make a living as a fiction author, you have to create
    more books, preferably in a linked series of books, faster than ever before. And
    then market and share those books around the world in the most efficient way possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Books are a luxury to many readers in the current harsh economic climate.
    If you want to make a living, you have to provide an entertaining romance that
    your readers will purchase, read, enjoy, and then immediately buy the next book
    in the series. And that reader wants the book now. Not in a month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, there are some romance readers who will not invest time and money on
    the first book in a series until they know that the next book or books are complete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    series until the third is complete and release all three over a short time period.
  prefs: []

- en: And therein lies the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most romance authors do not write full-time. Every author has a different lifestyle
    and home life, but in my experience, genre fiction authors are real people who
    might have a day job to pay the bills, a family, a home to run, and children and/or
    relatives to take care of.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many romance authors I know personally, for example, decided to write fiction
    so that they could work from home and take care of their children, rather than
    go out for a paid day job. The income they generate from writing has to replace
    their wages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Asking romance authors to become more productive, so that they can write even
    more compelling, brilliant, captivating romance books, and produce them faster,
    is just adding more stress and pressure to an already busy life. And we know where
    that leads.
