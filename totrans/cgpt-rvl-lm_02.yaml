  zh: 第二章：自然语言处理的历史
- en: The development of natural language processing (NLP) can be traced back to the
    early days of computing in the 1950s. At that time, researchers were exploring
    the potential of computers to understand and analyze human language. However,
    progress was slow, and it wasn't until the 1970s that significant breakthroughs
    were made.

  zh: 自然语言处理（NLP）的发展可以追溯到20世纪50年代计算机的早期。当时，研究人员正在探索计算机理解和分析人类语言的潜力。然而，进展缓慢，直到20世纪70年代才取得重大突破。
- en: One of the earliest successes in NLP was the development of a system called
    SHRDLU by Terry Winograd at MIT. This system used a set of rules to interpret
    and respond to simple commands in English, such as "pick up the red block". While
    SHRDLU was limited in its capabilities, it represented an important proof-of-concept
    for NLP and set the stage for future advancements.

  zh: NLP中最早的成功之一是麻省理工学院的Terry Winograd开发的名为SHRDLU的系统。该系统使用一组规则来解释和响应英语中的简单命令，例如“拿起红色的方块”。虽然SHRDLU在功能上有限，但它代表了NLP的一个重要概念验证，并为未来的进步奠定了基础。
- en: In the following decades, researchers continued to refine and improve NLP technology.
    One major breakthrough came in the 1980s with the development of statistical methods
    for NLP, which allowed computers to analyze language data more effectively. This
    led to the development of systems like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which could
    automatically identify patterns in large sets of text data.
