    corporate greenhouse gas emissions. This growth persists despite skepticism over
    the accuracy of the data. According to the data company PitchBook, venture capital

    million in 2022\. This upward trajectory has carried on into 2023, with venture
    capitalists pouring $333 million into the sector thus far. This investment rush
    is stimulated by companies’ anticipation of intricate disclosure mandates expected
    to be implemented in Europe and the US within the next year. This is coupled with
    the pressure from investors and consumers to project an environmentally conscious
    image. The onset of the standards was initiated in June with the International
    Sustainability Standards Board’s introduction of guidelines for calculating emissions
    throughout supply chains. These standards proved to be more lenient than initially
    anticipated after the ISSB announced in December that corporations would be granted
    an additional year to report emissions throughout their entire value chain. Nonetheless,
    the implementation is acting as a catalyst for many businesses to embark on a
    more comprehensive level of tracking.”*'
