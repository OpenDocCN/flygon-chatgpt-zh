- en: ChatGPT is the hottest technology around as of this writing. A huge number of
    companies and organizations are using ChatGPT in the workplace. So are government
    bodies. Students, teachers, and administrators are using ChatGPT at all levels
    of education, from kindergarten through to postgraduate and doctoral. Entrepreneurs
    are using ChatGPT to turbocharge their productivity and create new products without
    raising their staffing costs. Even the military is using ChatGPT, both in the
    workplace and in the field (don't ask).

- en: '*ChatGPT* is an artificial intelligence tool created by the OpenAI research
    laboratory. OpenAI consists of two parts: a nonprofit organization called OpenAI
    Incorporated, and its for-profit subsidiary corporation, OpenAI Limited Partnership.
    OpenAI was founded in 2015 and is based in San Francisco, CA. OpenAI launched
    ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.'

- en: '**Transformer:** In machine learning, a *transformer* is a deep learning model
    that can give different weight (significance) to different parts of the input.
    For example, when you feed a sentence into a transformer, it gives the different
    words and phrases different significance rather than treating them all as equally
    important. Transformers are used mostly in natural language processing (NLP) and
    computer vision (CV).'

    a probability distribution over a given piece of text — a mathematical function
    that describes how probable it is that a particular word will occur. A *large
    language model* is simply a language model that uses a large amount of text.
