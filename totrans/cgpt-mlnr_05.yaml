    you’re often a one-man band who has to either learn how to do a lot of different
    things, which takes forever or outsource the work as it comes - which works but
    is expensive and there’s a lack of continuity should the same type of work come
    around again and the freelancer you used last time is not available.

    FAA. This includes the weight of the drone itself, as well as any additional payloads
    or equipment.

    strong bones and a healthy immune system.
  id: totrans-279
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes? Studies have shown that people with
    low levels of Vitamin D are more likely to develop these conditions.
  id: totrans-280

- en: Vitamin D is unique in that it is the only vitamin that can be produced by the
    body when our skin is exposed to sunlight. However, many people don't get enough
    Vitamin D from the sun alone, especially during the winter months or if they live
    in areas with limited sun exposure.
  id: totrans-281
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To ensure you're getting enough Vitamin D, it's important to consume foods that
    are high in Vitamin D, such as fatty fish, eggs, and fortified foods like milk,
    cereal, and orange juice. You can also take supplements, especially if you are
    at risk of deficiency due to a lack of sun exposure or other factors such as age,
    skin color, or medical conditions.
  id: totrans-282
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, as the sun comes out, don't forget to take advantage of the natural source
    of Vitamin D, but also make sure to include Vitamin D-rich foods in your diet
    and consider supplements to prevent deficiencies.
