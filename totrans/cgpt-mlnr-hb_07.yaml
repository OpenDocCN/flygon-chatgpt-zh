    at a problem or an idea from six different perspectives, each of which is represented
    by a different "hat." These "hats" are as follows: the White Hat represents information
    and facts, the Red Hat represents emotions and intuition, the Black Hat represents
    risks and challenges, the Yellow Hat represents benefits and opportunities, the
    Green Hat represents creativity and alternatives, and the Blue Hat represents
    process and organization. By giving ChatGPT instructions to adopt each of these
    views in turn, users can obtain a more comprehensive knowledge of their ideas
