Actually, temporary happiness is everywhere if we want to find it and search for it. Sometimes, it is just as close as a cute kitten to us, sometimes giving a hand to someone who is in need of us is enough. Even taking a breath may give somebody the absolute happiness at times. But what if we leave temporary happiness alone and decide to construct our lives on basic principles of permanent happiness? Certainly, these principles depend on one's characteristics and point of view. In my opinion, social relations, acceptance, and independence are the most important elements of permanent happiness in life. To begin with, social relations are very important for me to be happy in the general drift of my life. I should have good relations with the people around me for peace of my mind. If I have close and intimate friends with whom I can share my troubles, worries and also my joy, then it means that I have beaten life up to a very considerable point. In my opinion, someone who has real friends has the most valuable treasure of life. To obtain this treasure, I make friends with people whose principles resemble mine, whose characteristics best suit me, and who are sincere. Besides friends, I try to have good relations with the people I encounter somehow every day, like neighbors, acquaintances, teachers, relatives, and others. The second element of continuous happiness for me is acceptance: to clarify, acceptance of my characteristics, behaviors, choices, and desires. At one point, it can be defined as the acceptance of my existence as a real individual. As long as I am accepted and taken as I am, I can make right decisions for myself.

It is none of their business to interfere with me about the subjects that only interest me. To sum up, if I acquire success in social relations, independence, and acceptance, then it means that I have the golden key to make happiness an enduring element of my life. Obtaining all these elements may not be very easy. They may be achieved only in the long run, but there is something we should always bear in mind: achieving real and permanent happiness in life is not that easy, either.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the argument.

Write me a 500 word essay on my summer vacation\n```", "```\nLast summer, I had the opportunity to travel to Egypt for 10 days with my family. It was my first time visiting this beautiful country, and I was really excited to explore all the amazing places that I had heard so much about. We started our trip in Cairo, where we spent the first few days visiting all the famous landmarks such as the Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Egyptian Museum. Seeing the Great Pyramids in person was absolutely breathtaking. They are so massive and grand, and it's hard to imagine how they were built so many thousands of years ago. We also went inside one of the pyramids, which was a really cool experience. The Egyptian Museum was also really interesting, with so many artifacts from ancient Egyptian times, including the famous gold mask of King Tutankhamun. In addition to the historical sites, we also visited some modern attractions in Cairo such as the Cairo Tower and the Khan el-Khalili market. The Cairo Tower provided an incredible view of the entire city, and we got some great photos from the top. The market was a bustling and colorful place, filled with shops selling all kinds of goods, from spices to jewelry to souvenirs. After a few days in Cairo, we headed to Sharm El Sheikh, which is located on the coast of the Red Sea. This was a completely different experience from our time in Cairo, as we spent most of our time at the beach and doing water-related activities. The water in the Red Sea is so clear and blue, and we spent hours swimming and snorkeling among the coral reefs. We even went on a glass-bottomed boat tour to see the underwater world from a different perspective. One of the highlights of our time in Sharm El Sheikh was a day trip we took to the nearby desert. We rode camels and ATVs, and even went sandboarding down the dunes. It was a really fun and unique experience that we all enjoyed. Overall, my trip to Egypt was an unforgettable experience. I learned so much about ancient Egyptian history and culture, and also got to enjoy some beautiful natural scenery and modern attractions. It was amazing to see how different the city of Cairo was from the beach town of Sharm El Sheikh, and I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to experience both. I would definitely recommend Egypt as a travel destination to anyone who is interested in history, culture, and adventure.\n```"]
