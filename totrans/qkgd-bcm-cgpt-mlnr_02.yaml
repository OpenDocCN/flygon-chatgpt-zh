- en: I suggest you go through the book in order, but it’s ok if you just want to
    skip to Section II and dive right into the practical real-world ways to use ChatGPT
    to make money. There’s no right or wrong way to read this book, but Section I
    will give you a lot of background that will help you use ChatGPT more effectively.
