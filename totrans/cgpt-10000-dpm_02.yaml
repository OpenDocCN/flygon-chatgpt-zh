- en: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a specialized subfield of AI that deals
    with the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines
    to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful
    and contextually relevant. NLP allows computers to process vast amounts of text
    data, extract information, and respond in a way that resembles human conversation.
