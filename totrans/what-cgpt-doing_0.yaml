- en: This short book is an attempt to explain from first principles how and why ChatGPT
    works. In some ways it’s a story about technology. But it’s also a story about
    science. As well as about philosophy. And to tell the story, we’ll have to bring
    together a remarkable range of ideas and discoveries made across many centuries.

- en: For me it’s exciting to see so many things I’ve so long been interested in come
    together in a burst of sudden progress. From the complex behavior of simple programs
    to the core character of language and meaning, and the practicalities of large
    computer systems—all of these are part of the ChatGPT story.

- en: ChatGPT is based on the concept of neural nets—originally invented in the 1940s
    as an idealization of the operation of brains. I myself first programmed a neural
    net in 1983—and it didn’t do anything interesting. But 40 years later, with comput-ers
    that are effectively a million times faster, with billions of pages of text on
    the web, and after a whole series of engineering innovations, the situation is
    quite different. And—to everyone’s surprise—a neural net that is a billion times
    larger than the one I had in 1983 is capable of doing what was thought to be that
    uniquely human thing of generating meaningful human language.

- en: This book consists of two pieces that I wrote soon after ChatGPT debuted. The
    first is an explanation of ChatGPT and its ability to do the very human thing
    of generat-ing language. The second looks forward to ChatGPT being able to use
    computational tools to go beyond what humans can do, and in particular being able
    to leverage the computational knowledge “superpowers” of our Wolfram|Alpha system.

- en: It’s only been three months since ChatGPT launched, and we are just beginning
    to understand its implications, both practical and intellectual. But for now its
    arrival is a reminder that even after everything that has been invented and discovered,
    surprises are still possible.
