- en: Each morning when I would arrive at the office, I would hit the ‘on’ switch
    of my computer and then go and make a cup of tea. Typically, I would return to
    my desk in time to see the booting-up sequence finishing. I'd then enter my password,
    and have time to check my voicemail and say hello to colleagues before accessing
    my email.

  zh: 每天早晨我到办公室时，我会打开电脑的开关然后去泡杯茶。通常情况下，我会及时回到桌子前看到启动序列完成。然后我会输入密码，在查看语音邮件并和同事打个招呼之前有时间查看我的电子邮件。
- en: I reckon this all took around 10 minutes. Could you imagine waiting that long
    now for a computer to start up? The Mac I'm using to write this book takes less
    than a minute to be up and good to go, and sometimes I still find myself tapping
    my fingernails on the desk with impatience.

    wait time has now been reduced to a matter of minutes, if not seconds.

    of work: working from home, working overseas and all the hybrid models in between.
