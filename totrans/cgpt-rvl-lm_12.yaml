  zh: 尽管在教育中使用ChatGPT可能带来潜在的好处，但也有一些需要考虑的挑战。其中一个挑战是确保模型准确可靠。这需要进行广泛的培训和验证，以确保模型能够准确理解和回答学生的问题和需求。
- en: Another challenge is the need to ensure that ChatGPT is used ethically in education.
    For example, there is a risk that ChatGPT could be used to replace human teachers,
    which could have negative consequences for students' social and emotional development.
    Therefore, it is important to ensure that ChatGPT is used to complement, rather
    than replace, human teachers.
