- en: The release of ChatGPT—just a mere six months before the time of this writing—has
    ushered in a monumental paradigm shift. Over the previous decade, AI made significant
    advances in areas like data analysis, text and image recognition, and many other
    areas. However, language models lagged behind these other intelligences, at least
    until late 2022 with the monumental release of ChatGPT. Since then, many other
    generative AI large language models (LLMs) have surfaced, with giants like Google
    and Microsoft now competing for dominance in this new era of technology.

  zh: ChatGPT的发布——就在写作时间的短短六个月前——引领了一个重大的范式转变。在过去的十年里，人工智能在数据分析、文本和图像识别等领域取得了重大进展。然而，语言模型在这些其他智能领域落后，至少直到2022年底ChatGPT的重大发布。从那时起，许多其他生成式人工智能大型语言模型（LLMs）出现了，像谷歌和微软这样的巨头现在在这个新技术时代争夺主导地位。
- en: The advent of language models like ChatGPT represents an unprecedented technological
    advancement that demands attention. While every generation must adapt to and manage
    the impacts of new technologies, LLMs represent something different. In a remarkably
    short span of six months, these models have empowered employees across your firm
    to enhance their capabilities and productivity to an extent once unimaginable.
    However, considering the advances and potential of these new tools, the response
    to these transformative tools within traditional SMBs has been disappointingly
    slow. Despite generating substantial buzz in the media through extensive coverage
    in news outlets, papers, and podcasts, the implementation and harnessing of these
    language models by businesses have been woefully scarce. Few companies have taken
    any meaningful steps to leverage these tools. Even fewer seem to be aware that
    their old processes, methods, playbooks, and tool kits will now need a considerable
    overhaul.
