    for browsing the web, playing games, reading e-books and watching videos. I don't
    know about you, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on one, even though I didn't
    know what I would do with it!

    work, play and communicate. It has become a powerful tool for teaching and learning,
    not just in the classroom, but also for remote learning.

    innovatively, thanks to developers who saw the potential and created amazing apps
    that have completely revolutionised the way we use the iPad. Apps like Evernote,
    Proloquo2Go, GarageBand and Office365 have made it possible to create and organise
    information, communicate, and work remotely in ways it was never originally intended.
