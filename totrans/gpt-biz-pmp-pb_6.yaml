    statistics and credible references where possible. Nailed it, ChatGPT has added
    references. Make sure to double check all these!Unique content - Please only submit
    new posts that haven’t already been published on other websites or outlets. If
    you wish to repost it on your website afterwards, then you’ll need to wait twelve
    weeks before doing so and link it back to our original post so Google doesn’t
    think it’s duplicate content. This is brand new content, just written.Make it
    easy to read. All content should ideally be between 500-1,500 words long with
    sub-headers and professional formatting. Include practical takeaways and a detailed
    conclusion at the end of your piece. ChatGPT has hit all of this no problem.Include
    a short bio - Outline your experience and expertise in the area you're covering,
    include a link to your website homepage and your social media profiles. Weird
    one. ChatGPT has actually completed this requirement. By putting itself as the
    author - which it is! Replace this with you own bio.Don’t spam links - Only place
    links where they’re genuinely needed and it makes sense to do so. Nobody wants
    to read articles with a link every other sentence which feel like a marketing
    pitch. ChatGPT abided by this.Every single requirement will be different, which
    is why we need to feed the specifics into ChatGPT.Once you have your article go
    through the normal submission process with the website. If you need an email cover
    letter use ChatGPT to help generate this too.Repeat this until you have a solid
    (20+) backlinks. The more the better.
