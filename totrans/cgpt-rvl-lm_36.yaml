    calls, and emails, which could take weeks or even months to complete. With the
    implementation of ChatGPT, insurance companies can significantly reduce the amount
    of time it takes to process claims and interact with customers. ChatGPT can handle
    a variety of tasks, such as answering basic questions about policies, guiding
    customers through the claims process, and even analyzing data to detect potential
    fraud.
