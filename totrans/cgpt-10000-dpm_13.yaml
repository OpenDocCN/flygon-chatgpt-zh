- en: The "temperature" parameter controls the randomness of ChatGPT's responses.
    Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output more creative but may also lead to less
    coherent responses. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and
    deterministic. Experiment with different temperature settings to find the balance
    between creativity and relevance.
