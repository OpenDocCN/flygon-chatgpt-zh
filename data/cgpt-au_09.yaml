- en: 'Post-publicationRemember that I told you Amazon allows you to place your book
    on presale up to a year before it’s published?I set the publication date to thirty
    days later.There are several good reasons for this, but the main reason is that
    a book should be looked over by a professional editor before being published.
    Always.It doesn’t matter whether you wrote it, ChatGPT wrote it, or Stephen King
    wrote it.I recommend that you look on Upwork, if you have time but a limited budget,
    or on  [The Urban Writers](https://soykevinalbert.com/tuw)[10](part0040.xhtml)
    if you want peace of mind and a fast, professional result.Of course, you can also
    use this extra time to give your book to your beta readers and get as much feedback
    as you can.Even though one of the great advantages of self-publishing on a platform
    like Amazon is that, if you find any mistakes or want to change something after
    you publish, you can do it immediately, that’s no excuse not to make the first
    version your readers receive the highest possible quality.Of course, you don’t
    have to go down the self-publishing route first; you can send your book to an
    editor first and publish it directly once they send it back to you with corrections.
    But…Why not make the most of those days to get your passive income machine rolling
    and start generating interest among readers?Note: I also used those thirty days
    to optimize the cover (making sure it aligned with the visual identity of my other
    books) using a Freelancer[11](part0041.xhtml) contest. Below, I will show you
    the first covers created by Bing Image Creator that I used for the launch. There
    were two of them: one for the Spanish-language version and one for the English-language
    version.![](image_rsrcXW.jpg)'

  zh: 发布后记得我告诉过你，亚马逊允许你在书籍发布前一年进行预售吗？我将出版日期设定为30天后。有几个很好的理由，但主要原因是书籍在出版之前应该由专业编辑审查。这一点非常重要。无论是你写的、ChatGPT写的还是史蒂芬·金写的都无关紧要。我建议你在Upwork上寻找，如果你时间有限但预算有限，或者在[城市作家](https://soykevinalbert.com/tuw)上，如果你想要心安和快速、专业的结果。当然，你也可以利用这段额外的时间将你的书交给你的测试读者，并尽可能多地获得反馈。尽管自我出版在亚马逊等平台的一个很大的优势是，如果你在发布后发现任何错误或想要做出改变，你可以立即做出调整，但这并不意味着不要让读者收到的第一版尽可能高的质量。当然，你也不一定要首先选择自我出版的路线；你可以先将书稿交给编辑，一旦他们将其带回给你并进行了修正，就可以直接发布。但...为什么不充分利用这些日子来启动你的
    passsive income 机器并开始在读者中产生兴趣呢？注意：我还利用了那30天来优化封面（确保它与我的其他书籍的视觉识别相一致），使用了一个Freelancer竞赛。下面，我将展示我在发布时使用的Bing
    Image Creator创建的第一批封面。其中有两个版本：一个是西班牙语版本，另一个是英语版本。![](image_rsrcXW.jpg)
