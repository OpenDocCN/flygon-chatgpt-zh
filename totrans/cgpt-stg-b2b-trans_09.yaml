    idea, the content and writing are my own. However, it is the great colleagues
    and mentors I’ve had in my education and career who truly deserve credit for the
    ideas in this book. I’m thankful to them and to the people who have continued
    to collaborate with me through writing this book. I’m grateful to several in particular
    for the time they invested in challenging and refining these ideas and inspiring
    creativity.

    sure he would have been amazed as both a technologist and educator. He’d routinely
    help me with my own writing, and rest assured that this book would have been significantly
    better if he were still with us. I’m grateful every day for my own “compound interest”
    that stemmed from his love, care, and support. This book is dedicated to his memory.

- en: It is imperative that business leaders see these technologies in action and
    experience them firsthand, as it’s hard to develop a true appreciation for their
    immense power by merely reading about them. To facilitate this, we’ve placed several
    videos on our website that show ChatGPT in action and illustrate the examples
    outlined in this book. In addition, readers can find further information on generative
    AI and other related topics explored in this book, such as the Agile Strategy
    Framework.
