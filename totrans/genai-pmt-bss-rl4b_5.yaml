- en: Limited Creativity:While generative AI creates something new, no out-the-box
    thinking is involved, as the output produced is usually a combination of the data
    fed into the neural network. In other words, AI systems need more ingenuity. They
    cannot conceptualize or conceive an idea independently because they rely on human
    input to generate those ideas. However, the pattern recognition capabilities of
    machine learning and the creative aspects of generative AI are similar to the
    chakra functions in the 6th Yoga Human Energy System.

    the last 7th chakra for the ability to understand and conceptualize information?
    These traits set us apart from other animals; humans could face extinction.
