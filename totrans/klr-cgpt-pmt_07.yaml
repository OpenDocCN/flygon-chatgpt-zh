- en: IF YOUR DUTIES include creating web copy, web pages, or even entire websites,
    ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant. You can get ChatGPT to take on a wide range
    of duties—anything from analyzing competitive websites all the way through drafting
    web-page content to creating HTML, CSS, and scripts for you. This chapter points
    you toward the actions you're likely to find most immediately helpful.

- en: 'For any of the prompts in this chapter that require full access to the web,
    such as analyzing a website, you''ll need to use ChatGPT''s Web Browsing Model.
    For other prompts, you may be able to use either the Web Browsing Model or another
    model. For example, you can have ChatGPT analyze a web page by pasting its contents
    into the Send a Message field instead of accessing the web page directly on its
    website.  ## Analyze Competitive Websites'
