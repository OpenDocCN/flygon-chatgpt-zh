- en: I  am not sure why you picked up this book, but I am glad you did. You may be
    looking for ideas on how to use chatGPT in your classroom. In that case, I hope
    it inspired you to propel your class forward. Or you may be looking for ways to
    shield students from artificial intelligence. But I hope that is not the case.
    Artificial intelligence is here to stay. Over the years, you will see its use
    increase in importance and frequency. We should take advantage of AI to make the
    world better. Computers are a force multiplier that can help us do work quickly
    so we can focus our attention on more pressing issues.

  zh: 我不确定您为什么选择阅读这本书，但我很高兴您这样做了。您可能正在寻找如何在课堂上使用chatGPT的想法。在这种情况下，我希望它能激励您推动班级前进。或者您可能正在寻找方法来保护学生免受人工智能的影响。但我希望不是这种情况。人工智能已经到来。多年来，您会看到其在重要性和频率上的应用增加。我们应该利用人工智能使世界变得更好。计算机是一种可以帮助我们快速完成工作的力量倍增器，这样我们就可以将注意力集中在更紧迫的问题上。
- en: Throughout history, some educators have bristled at the introduction of new
    technologies and their impact on teaching and learning. For example, Plato spoke
    of the effect of writing in *Phaedrus*, “Enough of the art of speaking; let us
    now proceed to consider the true use of writing. There is an old Egyptian tale
    of Theuth, the inventor of writing, showing his invention to the god Thamus, who
    told him that he would only spoil men’s memories and take away their understandings.”
    Likewise, there has been criticism and angst over each new technology and its
    impact on education. Search, and you will find complaints regarding the introduction
    of computers, the internet, the digitization of libraries, etc. Artificial intelligence
    will change teaching and learning, as have all the previous technologies. However,
    our role as educators is to prepare students for the future.

  zh: 在整个历史上，一些教育工作者对新技术的引入及其对教学和学习的影响感到不满。例如，柏拉图在《斐德洛斯》中谈到了写作的影响：“让我们不再谈论演讲的艺术，而是继续考虑写作的真正用途。有一个古老的埃及传说，讲述了写作的发明者Theuth向神Thamus展示他的发明，后者告诉他，这只会破坏人们的记忆并剥夺他们的理解力。”同样，每一种新技术及其对教育的影响都受到批评和焦虑。搜索一下，您会发现关于引入计算机、互联网、图书馆数字化等的抱怨。人工智能将改变教学和学习，就像以往的所有技术一样。然而，我们作为教育工作者的角色是为学生未来做好准备。
- en: Please give chatGPT a test drive. I am confident you will be fascinated with
    what you discover. However, remember that it is an emerging technology that has
    not yet been perfected. Each iteration will become better. Also, note that chatGPT
    is free as I write this book, but that may not always be the case.

  zh: 请试用chatGPT。我相信您会对您所发现的内容感到着迷。但请记住，这是一种尚未完善的新兴技术。每一次迭代都会变得更好。另外，请注意，截至我写这本书时，chatGPT是免费的，但情况可能并非总是如此。
