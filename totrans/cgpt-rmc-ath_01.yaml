- en: Artificial intelligence is a broad field of computer science focused on creating
    systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

- en: A key component of AI is Natural Language Processing. NLP allows machines to
    understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful
    and contextually appropriate.

- en: In the case of language models like ChatGPT, these algorithms are trained using
    vast amounts of data. By processing millions of sentences, phrases, and words,
    the AI model learns the structure of a language, grammar rules, common phrases,
    and facts.

- en: ChatGPT is based on a type of machine learning model known as a transformer
    neural network, specifically, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer model.

- en: 'Training ChatGPT involves two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. During
    pre-training, the model is exposed to a vast dataset containing parts of the internet.'

    set or have access to any specific documents or sources.

- en: Instead, it learns to predict the next word in a sentence based on the words
    it has seen so far. Then, it is fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from
    human feedback, focusing it on more specific tasks, like maintaining a coherent
    conversation or writing a piece of fiction.

- en: The first GPT model, GPT-1, was a proof-of-concept model developed by OpenAI
    in 2018\. GPT-3, unveiled in June 2020, took things a step further, with a massive
    leap in the size of the model and its capabilities. Each iteration improved the
    language model's ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant sentences,
    and respond effectively to various prompts.

    based on its training.

    model.

- en: The primary purpose of ChatGPT is to generate human-like text based on the prompts
    it's given. ChatGPT can understand and continue a text based on the context provided
    by the prompt, making it useful for various purposes, from drafting emails to
    tutoring in various subjects, and writing fiction.

- en: Within a single conversation, ChatGPT's understanding is bound by a window of
    'memory' or context length defined by 'tokens.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A token is a chunk of text that can be as short as one character or as long
    as one word in English (e.g., 'a,' 'apple'). In other languages, a token might
    not correspond to a whole word.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The maximum number of tokens that ChatGPT can handle at once – the 'context
    window' – limits the conversation length. If a conversation exceeds this limit,
    the AI loses sight of the earlier tokens, affecting its ability to maintain context
    and coherence.

- en: ChatGPT-4 has a larger model size, which corresponds to improved fluency, creativity,
    and comprehension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means that ChatGPT-4 can generate higher-quality outputs, particularly in
    complex tasks or long conversations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we look to the future, continual advancements in AI tools such as ChatGPT
    will improve the ability of these tools to support creative writing projects,
    while still maintaining your unique author voice and writing style.
