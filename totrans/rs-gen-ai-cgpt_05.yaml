- en: Generative AI works by learning patterns and relationships in data to generate
    new content that is similar in style and format to the original data. The quality
    of the generated content depends on the quality and quantity of the training data
    used to develop the AI model. If the training data is accurate, diverse, and representative
    of the target audience, the generated content is more likely to be authentic and
    valid.

    content. For example, Generative AI may produce content that is grammatically
    correct but semantically incorrect or misleading. This can be a concern in applications
    where accuracy and precision are critical, such as legal or medical documentation.

- en: As ChatGPT is not updated with recent data and also it is trained on widely
    past databases, it might be possible to have not perfectly validated and well-updated
    data. In high-end diligent applications, such as legal contracts or medical reports,
    it may be necessary to have human oversight and validation to ensure the accuracy
    and reliability of the content.
