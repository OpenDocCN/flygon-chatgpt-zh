    you look at ten other generative AI tools that contribute to the advancement of
    AI and natural-language processing. Each is unique in terms of strengths and weaknesses,
    and in features and capabilities. You might find that a different model, one made
    by OpenAI or another company, would be more useful for a given project or a better
    fit with your preferences. Because more alternatives are coming, it’s worthwhile
    to look around periodically to make sure you’re using the generative AI model
    that bests fits your needs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The suggestions in this chapter are not meant to discount the incredible breakthrough
    that ChatGPT represents, the hard pivot in human acceptance of AI that its release
    marked, nor its role as a harbinger of existential change. Any interpretation
    of ChatGPT as a simple word-pattern prediction tool is a gross underestimation
    of the notable human achievements required to make it and the powerful nature
    of the tool itself.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DALL-E and DALL-E 2 are ChatGPT siblings. These models generate computer images
    described by users in text and images entered as a prompt. The user doesn't need
    to be skilled in photography or other visual arts. However, renderings from a
    professional artist will be far more sophisticated because their prompts are.
    Note that AI-generated images are not currently protected by copyright in the
    US and several other countries.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DALL-E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 that generates images rather
    than text. DALL-E 2 is an optimized version that generates more realistic images
    with a greater degree of accuracy and four times the resolution. Which you use
    is often a matter of personal preference and your requirements. For example, a
    lower resolution is usually preferred for images and icons on web pages whereas
    a higher resolution is required for large photo prints and metaverse renderings.
  prefs:

    If you've already set up an OpenAI account to use ChatGPT, you can begin to use
    DALL-E or DALL-E 2 immediately. If you haven’t yet used ChatGPT, go to the same
    link for DALL-E or DALL-E 2 and follow the prompts to set up a free OpenAI account,
    which then gives you access to ChatGPT and DALL-E or DALL-E 2.

    add elements in the same style and background as the image to create a new image
    or tell a bigger story. It can also outpaint, or extend an image beyond its borders,
    by analyzing the overall image and using cues such as the paint colors on the
    edges of the image. For a wonderful timelapse depiction of the outpainting process

    the prompt that generated the image. If you mark an image as a favorite, it's
    stored under Favorites in History. You can create and share collections of the
    images you prompted in private or public mode by clicking Collections and following
