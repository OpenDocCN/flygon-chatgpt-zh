    ordinary life. Yes, it’s that simple. The term “Inciting Incident” is often used
    in screenwriting and movie production as well as novel writing, but we chose to
    call it “conflict” because it’s more specific. This single event does not necessarily
    need to be tense, dramatic, or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting
    incident will depend on your genre. However, it does need to force the main character
    into changing, which then “incites” the story. Without change precipitated by
    conflict, there is no story.)

    a challenging question with equally wonderful or horrific consequences. The best
    Choice in any scene leaves the reader arguing with himself over which option is
    best for the character and unable to put the book down, insistent on finding out
    what the character decides. Determining the intensity of the Choice is often a
    case of splitting hairs and not nearly as important as making sure the question
    facing the main character is a supremely difficult one. We are compelled to turn
    the page or keep watching when we empathize with the character, running the odds
    on the consequence of the decision as if it were our own. Make it difficult on
    the character and your reader will follow.)
