    a transformer, a system that can focus on various elements of its input - similar
    to how our human attention works. This enables it to understand intricate relationships
    within the text and maintain consistency, even across longer passages.Training
    ChatGPT is a two-tiered process. The initial phase, pretraining, involves exposing
    the model to a vast amount of text, teaching it to predict the subsequent word
    in a sentence. This phase is unsupervised; it autonomously discerns patterns in
    the data without specific guidance.The second phase, referred to as fine-tuning,
    sharpens the model''s responses using a more specialized dataset. This dataset
    provides examples of desired behavior and ranks differing responses. This fine-tuning
    stage enhances the model''s reliability and safety, ensuring it more accurately
    reflects human values and intentions.Multimodal CapabilitiesA major advancement
    in GPT-4, and thus ChatGPT, is its multimodal capabilities. This means it can
    process different types of data – specifically, images and text. This capability
    allows ChatGPT to handle tasks like describing images, summarizing text from screenshots,
    and answering questions that contain diagrams.Controlling OutputsTo further control
    ChatGPT''s behavior, OpenAI introduced what is referred to as "system prompts."
    A system prompt is a directive given in natural language to specify the model''s
    tone of voice or task. This term "system prompts" is interchangeable with what
    you might have heard referred to as a "system message". The model is designed
    to adhere to this system prompt throughout the conversation, providing users with
    more control over the interaction. As we delve into the next part of this book,
    we will focus on crafting effective prompts, and so, to maintain language consistency,
    we''ll refer to these as “prompts” henceforth.Interacting with External InterfacesChatGPT,
    an advanced artificial intelligence model, possesses the potential to interact
    with external interfaces such as the internet or specific software programs. This
    remarkable capacity extends its functionalities far beyond its inherent knowledge
