- en: This book was completed about six months after ChatGPT was released for public
    use. Just six months earlier, nobody had heard of ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, or the
    many other generative AI tools. At that time, it looked like technology might
    displace jobs like factory workers (automation and robotics), call-center operators
    (relocation and outsourcing), and eventually truck drivers (autonomous vehicles).
    Today, it looks more like accountants, lawyers, doctors, and programmers—all due
    to the monumental advances offered by language models. Today, *digital transformation*
    has a completely different meaning and strategy than it did just six months ago.
    The game has reset and changed, and what the next several months or years will
    look like is anybody’s guess.

    they need to get their hands dirty and *use ChatGPT* to fully grasp its capabilities
    and the disruption it will have on their business. Your eyes will open, and you’ll
    realize just how much things have changed. Through using it, you’ll realize that
    people’s habits must change and that leaders must set expectations and provide
    a strong-motive force for adoption.

    Success in the future will matter less about how smart you are or how hard you
    work and more about how you’re using this technology. With technologies now smarter
    than ourselves, which can now communicate like people, using those technologies
    will be the critical success factor over the next several years. Firms who put
    these tools to work sooner will reap compound interest that laggards just won’t
    be able to ever catch. Beyond the tools available in the public domain, firms
    that localize, train, and build interfaces to these technologies will gain an
    even further edge.

    two rounds of golf, thirty-six holes, for one hundred dollars?”

- en: “OK, here’s the interesting part,” I said as I used my phone’s calculator. “Even
    though you would have had only five dollars after nine holes, after playing eighteen
    holes, those pennies would be worth over $2,500\. And at twenty-seven holes, you’d
    become a millionaire. Two rounds of golf would be worth over $600 million. And
    the stack of pennies would be so tall that it could stretch around the world two
    and a half times.”

  zh: “好了，这里是有趣的部分，”我说着，用手机的计算器。“尽管你在打完九洞后只剩下五美元，但打完十八洞后，那些便士将价值超过$2,500。而在二十七洞时，你将成为百万富翁。两轮高尔夫将价值超过6亿美元。而那堆便士将如此之高，以至于可以绕地球两个半圈。”

- en: 'I added some things as we continued to play the Topgolf game: “Playing three
    rounds of golf would be worth four and a half times all the money that exists
    in the world. The stack of pennies would extend well outside the solar system.
    Izzy, right now, whether it’s in golf, school, or other areas, you’re playing
    just the front nine. But that front nine is crucial because, in life, things don’t
    just add together—they multiply together. That’s why everybody wants you to learn
    things and get good at things now.” I told her a little about Albert Einstein,
    who is said to have called compound interest the most powerful force in the universe.
    “We might sometimes push you too hard, but there’s a good reason for it.”'

  zh: 在我们继续玩Topgolf游戏的过程中，我补充了一些东西：“打三轮高尔夫将价值是世界上所有金钱的四倍半。那堆便士将延伸至太阳系之外。伊齐，现在，无论是在高尔夫、学校还是其他领域，你只是在打前九洞。但这前九洞至关重要，因为在生活中，事情不只是简单相加——而是相乘。这就是为什么每个人都希望你现在学习事物并擅长事物。”我向她讲了一点关于阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的事情，据说他称复利为宇宙中最强大的力量。“我们有时可能会对你施加过多压力，但这是有充分理由的。”
- en: Companies are now faced with an immediate and immense opportunity as the reset
    button has been pressed. These initial months will be about their own compound
    interest, about launching a virtuous cycle of productivity and growth in their
    business. Even though it might seem like pennies at first, those pennies will
    eventually multiply and begin to add up fast.

  zh: 公司现在面临着一个即时而巨大的机会，因为重置按钮已经按下。这些最初的几个月将关乎他们自己的复利，关乎在他们的业务中启动生产力和增长的良性循环。尽管起初可能看起来像是便士，但这些便士最终将开始倍增并迅速累积起来。
