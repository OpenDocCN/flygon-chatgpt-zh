- en: 'IntroductionThere I was, sitting for hours in front of my laptop, staring at
    a blank Word document. The words simply wouldn’t come. It was nothing new; call
    it writer’s block, call it lack of inspiration, call it- I don’t know- Monday…whatever.
    The point was that I was stuck.And mad.How could it be that there are robots that
    will clean your house from top to bottom, or drive a truck for hundreds of miles,
    but none that could help me to write a book? Even if it was just a little bit.At
    that moment, I could scarcely imagine what was around the corner. And it was going
    to rock the world.Welcome to a new reality! The reality of artificial intelligence
    (AI) and ChatGPT. A reality where, finally, machines can write a book. And not
    just a little bit.I’m not talking about hundreds of robots sitting in factory
    lines in front of typewriters. No, the truth is at once less dramatic and more
    revolutionary. When we talk about AI in the writing world, we’re talking about
    technology that can generate content, edit, correct and even help you sell your
    book. We’re talking about ChatGPT.Simply put, ChatGPT is an AI tool trained with
    a large quantity of information and designed to understand your questions and
    provide relevant, coherent answers. A virtual assistant you can ask questions,
    request help with different tasks or simply have a conversation.It''s like a super-journalist
    who can write at crazy speeds with a quality many can only dream of, and it doesn’t
    need to take a break to stretch its legs, see what there is in the refrigerator
    or check how many likes its latest insta post has received.And this is where a
    lot of people break out in a cold sweat. Does this mean that we writers are going
    to be replaced by this new technology?Personally, I don’t think so. At least,
    not yet.At the moment, ChatGPT has its shortcomings: it can give incorrect answers,
    it lacks creativity and subjectivity, its contextual understanding is limited
    and its knowledge is not up-to-date.But don’t underestimate its potential. Just
    think about AI as a puppy that needs to be trained. If you give it the right guidance
    and instructions, the possibilities are limitless. It’s up to us to teach it manners
    and stop it from biting the neighbors.You might be thinking: “Another tool to
    learn how to use? I don’t have it in me any more!”. But don’t worry – quite the
    opposite. On the one hand, to get the most out of ChatGPT, you don’t need to be
    a ChatGPT expert. Remember, it’s designed to understand you, and although you
    will probably get better at it with time and practice, you can take advantage
    of it from the first minute. On the other hand, ChatGPT will become a great ally
    for optimizing your time, taking care of the most tedious tasks and accelerating
    processes so you can devote your time to what really matters to you. Or to whatever
    you want. Netflix session while ChatGPT decides where the commas and apostrophes
    go? Why not?!I don’t believe that AI has come to put us out of a job. Not all
    of us, anyway. If we can adapt and make the best of it, it will help us improve
    our profession and in turn our quality of life. Think of it as your new writing
    assistant, like an enthusiastic intern who doesn’t need coffee or to figure out
    their work-life balance.So, whether you’re a bestselling author or aspiring to
    be one, or you simply like the idea of combining tech and writing…buckle up! You’re
    about to embark on an exciting journey where you’ll discover how artificial intelligence
    is going to change the world as we know it.We may have reached a point in history
    where writing well is no longer enough to triumph in the literary world. Maybe,
    as evolution has shown us for millions of years, it’s not the best person who
    prevails and wins the battle, but the one who best adapts to change.Don’t get
    left behind. Let’s go!'
