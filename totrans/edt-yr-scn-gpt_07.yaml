    its foundational storytelling principles can be adapted across all genres. At
    the heart of the analysis is the Three Story Method, emphasizing the crucial elements
    of Conflict, Choice, and Consequence. These pillars are not just exclusive to
    science fiction; they are universal cornerstones that breathe life into any compelling
    narrative, whether it’s romance, mystery, historical fiction, or any other genre.
