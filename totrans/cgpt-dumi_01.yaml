- en: It's easy to think of ChatGPT as a one-off phenomenon or a hot new trend given
    its abrupt and sensational emergence on the public scene. But this technology
    is a harbinger of immense and permanent change. Whether it ultimately succeeds
    or fails, ChatGPT is changing how we work, play, live, and interact with the world
    around us. It's also paving the way for the advancement of AI as a permanent fixture
    and influencer in the human experience.

    its rapid progression. This book is intended to help bring you up to speed on
    how it works and how to use it. Yes, ChatGPT will continue to advance after this
    book is published, but you’ll still have a working knowledge of the technology
    that you can build upon while continuing to learn as changes occur. Further, you'll
    have skills that will help you adapt to and use other AI models, some inevitably
    far more advanced as time marches on.

    that your gut reaction is common and not entirely unwarranted. This technology
    will most certainly change the nature of work and how your job is done. But also
    know that AI is not going to take jobs away from most people. Someone good at
    using AI will. Be that someone!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you can find lots of content about ChatGPT on YouTube and in blogs,
    articles, social media, and elsewhere, this book is one of the first, if not the
    first, comprehensive text on the topic, especially at the beginner or introductory
    level. And make no mistake. Outside of a select group of AI scientists, everyone
    is a beginner when it comes to ChatGPT. Take comfort in knowing that you're learning
    alongside millions of other people worldwide.

    ways in this book to leverage what you already know and new things to incorporate
    in your efforts to get even more out of ChatGPT.

    models that undergird ChatGPT but are also used as the AI models for applications
    other than this chatbot.

- en: References to ChatGPT-like models may or may not mean that they are technically
    similar to ChatGPT. For example, competing models may or may not have large language
    models (LLMs) as their foundation, as ChatGPT does, but they are still referred
    to as “similar” here because their user interface and function closely resemble
    those of ChatGPT. In this way, you can more easily compare and understand the
    various generative AI chatbots on the market without getting dragged through the
    technical weeds.

    in print and want to visit one of these web pages, simply type the address exactly
    as it’s noted in the text, pretending the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re
    reading this as an e-book, you have it easy; just click the web address to be
    taken directly to the web page.

    For instance, I assume that you possess no understanding or a limited understanding
    of ChatGPT. I assume also that you have at least a basic level of comfort and
    skill in working with computing devices, browsers, and web applications. Finally,
    I also assume, as it is with every Dummies book, that you are smart and pressed
    for time and therefore want all meat and no fluff in a fast and easy read. I hope
    I’ve hit that mark for you.

    you want to know ChatGPT in more detail. Also feel free to read the chapters in
    any order. Each chapter is designed to stand alone, meaning you don’t have to
    know the material in previous chapters to understand the chapter you're reading.
    Start anywhere and finish when you feel you have all the information you need

    book as you go. Many find it easy to follow along this way. But however you choose
    to learn and experiment with ChatGPT, you’ll likely find yourself catching on
    quickly. That’s the beauty of this class of AI — it’s very easy to use. The hardest
    part is stretching your own imagination to allow yourself to reach further with
    each new project.
