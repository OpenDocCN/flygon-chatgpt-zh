- en: HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF NLPThe NLP was born in the middle of the twentieth
    century. However, the term "Natural Language Processing" was first coined in the
    50s by the American linguist and computer scientist Allen Newell. Newell was one
    of the first to understand the importance of natural language processing for the
    development of artificial intelligence and proposed using machine learning and
    natural language recognition techniques to create machines that can understand
    human language.The first natural language processing project was the "Teodele,”
    a project developed in Italy in the 50s and 60s that aimed to create a system
    capable of automatically translating natural language into machine code.The project
    was funded by the Italian government and was developed at the University of Pisa
    in collaboration with other Italian universities and research centers. The scientific
    direction of the project was entrusted to Professor Antonio Zampolli, who later
    became one of the most critical experts in computational linguistics in Italy
    and, at that time, was a professor of General Linguistics and Computational Linguistics
    at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Pisa. Other team members included
    computer scientists Antonio Marti and Piero Molinelli, linguists Gianfranco Berardi
    and Giuseppe Grossi, and many others.The Teodele project's technology relied on
    syntactic text analysis to detect speech and sentence structure components. Unfortunately,
    the system was handicapped by natural language’s richness, making it impossible
    to discern ambiguities and nuances of meaning. Nevertheless, despite the project's
    failure, Teodele's research team made significant contributions to the growth
    of NLP, particularly in syntactic analysis, dictionaries, and machine translation
    rules.NLP made significant gains in the 1960s and 1970s due to the introduction
    of the first computers and innovative natural language processing techniques.Around
    this time, several universities and research institutions worldwide began developing
    natural language analysis and machine translation programs. They concentrated
    on constructing dictionaries and grammatical rules for language processing, which
    was the foundation for developing language processing algorithms.The SHRDLU project,
    founded by American researcher Terry Winograd at the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology, was one of the first essential undertakings of this time (MIT). SHRDLU
    was an artificial intelligence software that interacted with users and manipulated
    virtual objects in a virtual world by using simplified natural language. The study
    revealed the capability of developing natural-user interfaces for machine control,
    but it also illustrated the limitations of rules-based natural language processing.The
    earliest natural language analysis systems based on machine learning techniques
    were created in the 1970s. Gerald Gaspar, an English scholar, pioneered the notion
    of "context grammar," a syntactic approach that employed machine learning techniques
    to understand natural language grammatical principles. Several of the shortcomings
    of rules-based language processing systems were overcome by this method.NLP began
    to find practical applications in numerous domains, such as machine translation,
    sentiment analysis, online query processing, generating chatbots and virtual assistants,
    and much more in the 1980s and 1990s.Throughout the 2000s, NLP research concentrated
    on developing statistical models for natural language processing that employed
    enormous data to train models. These statistical models are useful for machine
    translation, text production, and sentiment analysis applications.Deep learning
    techniques, particularly neural networks, have enabled considerable advancement
    in NLP in recent years. The use of neural network-based language models, such
    as recurrent neural networks and transformative neural networks, in particular,
    has enabled the development of models capable of generating coherent and natural
    text, answering user questions, and comprehending the context in which natural
    language is used.Furthermore, the employment of reinforcement learning models
    has enabled the development of conversational bots capable of interacting with
    users increasingly naturally and fluidly.
