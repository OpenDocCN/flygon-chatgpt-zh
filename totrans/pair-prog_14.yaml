    am grateful to everyone who contributed their time and sometimes their money to

    to share a well-considered opinion. He edited and co-authored my book Don’t Say
    That at Work and has been with me every step of the way with this book. I couldn’t
    have done it without him. Follow Greg on Twitter at @ByGregMarine and receive
    a daily dose of optimistic wisdom.
