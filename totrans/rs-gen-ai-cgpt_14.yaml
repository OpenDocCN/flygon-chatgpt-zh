    players in a variety of ways. For example, chatbots powered by ChatGPT can provide
    personalized recommendations for games based on a player’s preferences and playing
    history. They can also answer frequently asked questions about games and provide

    gaming experience by providing an immersive environment that feels more like playing
    with a human opponent than a machine. It’s possible to utilize ChatGPT to create
    conversation for video games. The norms of game dialogue may be taught to the
    model using a dataset of already-written game scripts, and the model can then
    utilize this information to generate new, branching dialogues for NPCs (non-player
    characters) in the game. This enables the creation of more vivid and engaging
    game environments for players to explore. The newer versions are expected to cope
    with the metaverse environment and give a new roadway to design the gaming setups
