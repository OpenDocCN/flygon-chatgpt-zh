- en: Neural networks are a key component of many machine learning algorithms, as
    they consist of interconnected neurons that can recognize patterns in data and
    make predictions based on that data.

- en: This process is known as backpropagation. It allows the network to learn from
    input data, and improve its accuracy and performance, on both training and new
    unseen input data.

    teach them about its taste. You give them various samples of pizza and describe
    each flavour, and over time, your friend learns to recognize and appreciate the
    different tastes. That's similar to how neural networks are trained.
