    it continues to operate. The existing business must sustain its operations as
    we make design changes, ensuring a seamless transition. Successfully navigating
    such a transformation requires a delicate balance. We must introduce new ingredients

    firms can draw upon various methodologies and playbooks for strategic planning.
    While there may be slight variations among these methods, they share common foundational
    elements. One renowned approach, the Balanced Scorecard, introduced by Robert
    Kaplan and David Norton, offers valuable insights and methods. We borrow key elements
    from this tool kit, such as strategy maps for visualizing strategy and scorecards
    for monitoring implementation and effectiveness. By utilizing these tools, businesses
    can develop, plan, align, and execute their strategies. The Balanced Scorecard’s
    four perspectives—financial, customer, process, and employee—serve as a helpful
    framework for organizing objectives, establishing linkages, and ensuring comprehensive
    focus across different aspects of the business. Interestingly, when viewed in
    reverse order, these perspectives reflect the essence of a business—good employees
    driving effective processes to serve customers and yielding positive financial
    outcomes.'

    designed for software development and known for its iterative and fast-paced approach,
    provides a valuable method for strategy execution in the fast-moving digital age.

    avoiding non-value-added activities, and delivering incremental value every day.'

    during defined time spans known as “sprints.” The backlog serves as a dynamic
    repository of possible initiatives and guides Agile teams in selecting and implementing
    the right initiatives based on customer needs and market demands. Regular “scrum”
    meetings ensure synchronization, accountability, and steady progress.

    Agile sprints create a mindset where every week matters. By implementing regular
    scrum sessions, teams and leaders establish a cadence for reviewing progress and
    addressing obstacles promptly. The iterative nature of Agile allows teams to make
    incremental strides toward the future-state vision, gaining valuable learnings
    along the way. This flexibility enables businesses to adapt their strategies and
    tactics based on successes and failures.
  prefs: []

    advances of generative AI—traditional, rigid strategic planning is a mismatch,
    and its execution speed will inevitably fall short. Agile offers the speed required
    to keep pace with technology advancements, customer behavior changes, and competitive
    dynamics. Agile’s approach of building incrementally, akin to assembling Lego
    blocks, allows for faster progress and better results. Moreover, Agile execution
    minimizes bureaucratic barriers and aligns well with the challenges faced by SMBs
    compared to larger corporations. By combining a well-crafted strategy and an Agile
    execution approach, businesses can effectively navigate the ongoing impacts of
    digital, adapt to changing circumstances, and achieve their desired outcomes.

    immense capabilities, using it remains unintuitive. It’s hard to trust, it often
    feels like cheating, and it can be threatening. While some might enthusiastically
    adopt its use, many mid- to late-career personnel will have trouble putting it
    to work. For an experienced copywriter, it’s hard *not* to write something, and
    it’s unnatural to have AI write it instead. For an experienced analyst, it’s hard
    to believe AI can do something in minutes that previously took them hours.'

    a level of output that would be considered hyperproductive today. People must
    calibrate new expectations of productivity. For businesses to excel, ChatGPT needs
    to become a habit, and old habits and “feels” need to be unlearned. ChatGPT must
    be used across many tasks during every workday, and optimizing productivity requires
    its nearly constant use.

    and foremost with sufficiently using ChatGPT. It’s not something that can be delegated.
    Immersion in these tools is critical to truly understand the challenges and opportunities

    For example, if marketing’s deadlines and budgets to write a new brochure don’t

    With a tighter deadline, it might be completed in under an hour, using ChatGPT

    on the organization to respond fast enough without a strong-motive force.

    and change management will therefore be critical. Using John Kotter’s eight-step
    change model, leaders can apply the basics of change management, including first
    steps like establishing a sense of urgency, forming a powerful guiding coalition,
    creating and communicating a vision, and empowering people to act on the vision.
    Our Agile Strategy Framework integrates the eight-step change model into the overall
    playbook for managing transformation.

    focus on both top-down initiatives and enabling bottom-up change. In many respects
    (though not absolute), steps one through six primarily concentrate on the top-down
    aspect, while steps seven and eight largely shift the focus to the bottom-up aspect.
    It is crucial for firms to drive planned, strategic changes through the program
    and embrace incremental, opportunistic, and unplanned change initiatives originating
    from individuals within the organization.
