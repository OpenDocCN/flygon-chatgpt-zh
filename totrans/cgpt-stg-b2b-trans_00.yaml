- en: The release of ChatGPT—just a mere six months before the time of this writing—has
    ushered in a monumental paradigm shift. Over the previous decade, AI made significant
    advances in areas like data analysis, text and image recognition, and many other
    areas. However, language models lagged behind these other intelligences, at least
    until late 2022 with the monumental release of ChatGPT. Since then, many other
    generative AI large language models (LLMs) have surfaced, with giants like Google
    and Microsoft now competing for dominance in this new era of technology.

- en: The advent of language models like ChatGPT represents an unprecedented technological
    advancement that demands attention. While every generation must adapt to and manage
    the impacts of new technologies, LLMs represent something different. In a remarkably
    short span of six months, these models have empowered employees across your firm
    to enhance their capabilities and productivity to an extent once unimaginable.
    However, considering the advances and potential of these new tools, the response
    to these transformative tools within traditional SMBs has been disappointingly
    slow. Despite generating substantial buzz in the media through extensive coverage
    in news outlets, papers, and podcasts, the implementation and harnessing of these
    language models by businesses have been woefully scarce. Few companies have taken
    any meaningful steps to leverage these tools. Even fewer seem to be aware that
    their old processes, methods, playbooks, and tool kits will now need a considerable
    overhaul.

    bold firms to gain a significant competitive advantage swiftly. Companies that
    grasp the magnitude of these game-changing developments and take some sensible
    steps to adopt their use can leapfrog ahead of competitors whose adoption lags
    behind.

    ago, we couldn’t fathom such extraordinary abilities. Yet, with the advent of

    bestowed with veritable superpowers.

    on digital transformation have been made obsolete and can be placed in the trash
    bin. Consider placing many now-outdated sales-and-marketing books in the same
    circular file. A team that now possesses these superpowers requires a different
    playbook than a team of Clark Kents and Jimmy Olsens. When one can effortlessly
    “leap tall buildings in a single bound,” a ladder becomes obsolete. When one is
    now “faster than a speeding bullet,” even the fastest car now just slows them
    down. With tools like ChatGPT, the speed and productivity previously provided
    by now-outdated tools and playbooks may actually impede progress today. It’s time

    to realize a competitive advantage, and why many will get left behind. It’s something
    we call the “complex system problem.” Each of these six factors is essential in
    its own right, but effective transformation requires *all* of them to be put in
    place. Much like other complex systems with many interdependent components and
    parts, the probability of a firm achieving any *one* of these factors might be
    reasonable, but the probability of having *all* of them in place can be very low
    (since the fractional probabilities *multiply* together). Effective ChatGPT adoption
    requires a comprehensive and coordinated effort with all factors present, without
    which businesses will fail to harness the full potential of these tools.

    to fully appreciate why these tools have made such enormous advances, with more
    certainly to come. AI’s language capabilities have lagged behind other capabilities
    and are finally catching up. In addition, the recent exponential advances in language
    capabilities have brought together many “narrow” AI capabilities (chatbots, voice
    recognition, etc.) and other computing capabilities under a more “general” type
    of intelligence. This compounding of these capabilities has produced extraordinary
    power, very fast.

    these acts in many ways are strongly associated with thinking itself. Though LLMs
    don’t “think” the way we do, their output has amazing utility.

    sense that the impacts on your business would be significant? If this technology
    is so disruptive to make Google and Microsoft both scared and excited, certainly
    it is bound to have radical impacts on your business! Considering the other current

    for both the sake of immediate productivity and competitiveness and for the sake
    of the compound interest their learning and adaptation will produce in the future.
    The adoption of these tools will be a bigger success factor for most firms than
    any other consideration. Your own investments or how the economy evolves or even
    the other good or bad business decisions that you’ll make all pale in comparison
    to the importance of getting ahead in this new race.

    disruptions such as computers, the internet, or smartphones eventually became
    immense, none of them occurred instantaneously. The speed of ChatGPT’s disruption
    surpasses anything we have witnessed in our lifetimes, and there is simply no
    precedent for such a monumental shift. In addition, these tools are not only free;
    they also have the capacity to replace numerous products and offers currently
