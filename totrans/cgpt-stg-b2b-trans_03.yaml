    programming capabilities by orders of magnitude. But it’s important to note that
    anything multiplied by zero is zero. When it comes to programming and software
    capabilities, ChatGPT poses a “zero to one” proposition. To harness the immense
    power of this technology, employees need to possess the basics of software and
    programming and understand how computers “think” (e.g., being able to write pseudocode
    or knowing where to insert and execute an Excel macro). With ChatGPT, upskilling
    focuses more on breadth rather than depth—i.e., it is more valuable for individuals
    to know what software can do rather than precisely how to do it. For example,
    in Excel it’s more important to understand what a pivot table is versus how to
    construct one. With a modest investment in upskilling people from zero to one,
    ChatGPT’s amplification then gets them to a hundred. Then multiply that by the
    number of people in your organization.

    by seamlessly transitioning between ChatGPT, Excel, PowerPoint, and writing simple
    macros and code, even inexperienced users can create personalized assets, engage
    prospects, manage prospecting lists, merge multiple unstructured prospecting lists,
    and perform decent analytics on the data. Just as we demonstrated that Excel can
    compose an email in Outlook, ChatGPT enables users to easily pivot between software

    associated overall costs, including monetary and other costs. CRM tools offer
    certain benefits but can come with integration costs, high annual expenses, maintenance
    obligations, disruptions to productivity, and disengagement among sales personnel.

    large companies, the integrated and customized features offered by CRM tools are
    often unnecessary and not worth the expenditure or associated costs. Interestingly,
    even within large multinational conglomerates, some of the most successful front-end
    operations have been managed using Excel spreadsheets. This success can be partially
    attributed to smaller teams, proper business segmentation, flatter structures,
    and an overall ownership culture that is often eroded in large, top-down structures
    and systems and their accompanying tools. Do the benefits from culture matter
    more or less than the reporting capabilities and supposed efficiencies marketed
    by the software providers? It’s clear that many practices employed by large companies
    and embedded in today’s prevailing management wisdom simply do not align with
    the needs and culture of SMBs.

    with your current customers and therefore raise the value of your incumbency as
    a supplier. For example, as these tools become embedded in ERP systems, there
    is a likelihood that customers will expect your ERP system to “talk” to (i.e.,
    integrate into) their own ERP system. As another simpler example, consider a more
    frequent proactive solicitation of customer feedback, as they may be more inclined
    to provide it when they don’t have to invest time in writing a professional review
    and can simply provide a few bullet points through speech, allowing ChatGPT to
    process the rest.

    culture equipped for digital age transformation. Digital moves fast, and companies
    must adapt cultures to move at similar speeds. For companies, (1) Lean and (2)
    Agile provide overall playbooks for organizing people around continuous improvement.
    These methods can help firms improve for the sake of efficiency and performance
    or for the sake of innovation, like new offers, new technologies, and new business
    models. Both are very useful in facilitating the adoption of ChatGPT.'

    ChatGPT adoption. Fundamentally, methods like Lean focus on building cultures
    where employees engage in continuous improvement and problem-solving. Done properly,
    Lean builds a culture where everyone feels that they have a voice and responsibility
    to identify ways to improve the business. Without adequately enlisting your human
    capital, how else can a business develop the hundreds, if not thousands, of uses
    for ChatGPT across the enterprise? A Lean culture helps to engage people in continuous
    improvement and problem-solving, and in today’s digital world, a vast number of
    those means and solutions will inevitably be digital, including ChatGPT. Lean’s
    tool kit, including techniques like Kaizen, also provides playbooks for driving
    activities and adoption.

    adoption of ChatGPT, leaders should drive an initial step change and signal a
    new era of productivity and accompanying expectations. Continuous improvement
    methods can help drive this step change. While the specific approach may vary
    based on organizational culture and other factors, it is crucial for leaders to
    set clear expectations and communicate that the rules have changed. Employees
    at all levels must understand that embracing these tools and changing their habits
    is vital for the company’s forward competitiveness.

    the importance of simplicity, visual communication, and standardization to drive
    efficiency. In addition, by actively recording and sharing improvements, Akers
    aims to create a culture of learning and collaboration within the organization.
    This practice allows employees to inspire and learn from each other, spreading
    knowledge and best practices throughout the company. By openly sharing improvements,
    individuals can multiply the positive impact of their changes and motivate others
    to participate in continuous improvement efforts, including ChatGPT adoption.

    capability to coach employees through assignments that may be several steps above
    their current competence, and leaders must therefore reassess their approach to
    delegation. With the support and guidance of ChatGPT, employees can be entrusted
    with assignments that push their boundaries and require them to expand their capabilities.
    In addition to the direct productivity gains, this approach can also foster a

    throughout complex endeavors. As an example to illustrate this capability, consider
    valuation of companies, a task selected because it encompasses so many aspects
    of an MBA education. ChatGPT can walk non-MBAs through each stage of valuation,
    including cost of capital, discounted cash flow analysis, and more. Users can
    seek explanations, ask questions, and even receive help with setting up spreadsheets.
    Although there are some current limitations, future advancements will likely enhance
    ChatGPT’s ability to extract figures from annual reports and autonomously perform
    calculations. This empowers employees without an MBA education to tackle complex
    tasks that were previously reserved for highly skilled professionals.
