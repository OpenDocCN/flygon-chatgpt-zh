    boost your company's Sales and Marketing departments. We'll start by examining
    how to have ChatGPT create marketing content, such as blog posts, press releases,
    and marketing emails. After that, we'll see how to get ChatGPT to create sales
    content, using product descriptions and sales presentations as our examples. Toward
    the end of the chapter, we'll cover how to use ChatGPT to engage with customers
    via email, either drafting individual messages or drafting batches of messages.

    is eternally eager to shoulder more than its fair share of the burden and can

    content, and press releases. It can draft various types of email messages, such
    as newsletters and product announcements. And if you lack a marketing plan, ChatGPT
    can draw one up for you. The following subsections show you prompts for creating
    these materials.

    Personalized Email Messages'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can have ChatGPT draft batches of personalized email messages by merging
    data fields in a series of records into placeholders in a message template. This
    procedure works somewhat like a mail merge in a word processor such as Microsoft
    Word, except that it takes place in ChatGPT. It can be useful when you need to
    create customized individual messages to a number of individuals for whom you
    hold various pieces of information, such as their email address, name, and history
    of interactions with your company.
