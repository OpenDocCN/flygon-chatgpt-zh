    invoices, diving deep into the details to ensure precision and accuracy. While
    they process a multitude of invoices, we focus on three specific instances to
    illustrate the recurrent challenges they encounter in their daily operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the outset, FAID leverages its OCR-based **Information Extraction and Analytics**
    capability to meticulously scan and extract essential data from the invoices.
    Following this, the **Communication** and **Matchmaking** capabilities come into
    play as it cross-references the extracted details against the respective purchase
    orders and delivery receipts from the transactional system, aiming to pinpoint
    any disparities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first invoice, a discrepancy regarding the recorded delivery quantities
    surfaces. Taylor hypothesizes, “This doesn’t align with the delivery receipts.
    Could it be an error in the data entry during the recording at our end?” To validate
    this, FAID initiates a chat-based alignment with the warehouse staff, using its
    **Communication** function to verify the details. The warehouse staff confirms
    the mistake, and, with FAID’s help, they promptly correct the error in the system,
    updating the delivery receipt to mirror the accurate details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving onto the second invoice, a deviation in the pricing is evident. Taylor
    notes, “It seems the vendor has billed us based on their recent price hike, which
    isn’t reflected in the initial purchase order.” Here, FAID performs a contract
    analysis via its **Assessment** capability and discovers a stipulated price tolerance
    that had not been correctly set up in the system. Without missing a beat, FAID
    triggers a system configuration update in the transactional system using its **Communication**
    function to align with the contractual allowances, thereby rectifying the issue
    seamlessly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inspecting the third invoice, they find that the applied tax rate doesn’t align
    with what was stipulated in the purchase order. Taylor instructs, “FAID, it seems
    the vendor hasn’t applied the tax rate as per our agreement in the purchase order,
    can we reach out for clarification and re-verify this with them?” Utilizing its
    **Communication** capability again, FAID sends a notification to the vendor to
    rectify the applied tax rate in accordance with the pre-agreed terms in the purchase
    order, simultaneously blocking this invoice temporarily to avoid any complications.

    a pivotal role in this process. It systematically cross-verifies data across these
    documents, ensuring every detail aligns perfectly, avoiding any future conflicts
    or discrepancies. For instance, in one of the invoices, a discrepancy is spotted
    concerning the service duration recorded on the entry sheet and the invoice. To
    address this, FAID facilitates a chat between Taylor and the service provider
    to pinpoint the exact details and accordingly adjust the invoice, ensuring an
    accurate representation of the services rendered.

    anomaly catches Ahmed’s eye — a notable dip in cash flow consistently appearing
    at the end of every quarter. A perplexed Ahmed raises this with MoneyWatch, “This
    pattern seems unusual. MoneyWatch, can we perform a cause-effect analysis to understand
    why we witness this dip regularly?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MoneyWatch springs to action, sifting through a mountain of data to draw a comprehensive
    picture. It analyzes a range of variables including expenditure patterns, seasonal
    variations in business operations, and payment cycles. After a thorough analysis,
    it responds, “Upon reviewing the historical data, it appears that two primary
    factors are influencing this trend. Firstly, there is a significant disbursement
    of employee bonuses and incentives during this period. Secondly, utility bills
    witness a surge due to seasonal adjustments that coincide with the quarter-end.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ease the cash flow. He suggests, “To stabilize our cash flow, we should consider
    staggering the bonus distributions across different periods instead of a lump
    sum payment at the quarter-end. Similarly, we could negotiate a more balanced
    utility payment schedule with our service providers. MoneyWatch, what potential
    impact might these changes have on our cash flow?”

    representation of the improved cash flow under the new strategy. It projects a
    much smoother cash flow curve, devoid of the sharp dips witnessed previously.

    cash flow, allowing for better financial stability and improved fiscal health
    over the quarters.”

    breakdown, “The current fluctuation is influenced by our recent acquisition. The
    liabilities associated with this have temporarily influenced the equity ratio.
