    seeing news of ChatGPT across my social media feeds. Everyone raving about it,
    including Elon Musk, piqued my interest. The entire tech landscape was brimming
    with enthusiasm for ChatGPT’s possibilities – generating conversations with people
    using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

    to ask questions, tell stories, and make conversations like humans! I tried out
    with so many prompts, and I was blown away. It was astonishing to see that the
    responses were natural-sounding answers, as if a real human was talking to me.

    Siri and Alexa on Apple and Amazon, respectively, but it’s not the same. Unlike
    these two traditional AI chatbots that rely on predefined responses and decisions,
    ChatGPT is more sentient and can generate real-time human-like responses. It does
    this by learning patterns and relationships based on the data it’s trained on.
    The AI interface is well-structured to stimulate human conversations. You can
    naturally engage with the bot– like conversing with someone experienced and ready
    to talk to you about a topic of interest.

    the cons. ChatGPT isn’t all-knowing and can’t do everything. For example, blogging
    is about sharing information, ideas, memories, and stories. This requires real-life
    experience and conscious effort to put together. Although ChatGPT can produce
    content, write algorithms, or solve complex equations, it would need to experience
    things in real time to create and generate memories. Additionally, ChatGPT’s output
    relies on the training data at its disposal, which must be updated regularly.
