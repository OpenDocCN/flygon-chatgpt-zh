- en: 'CHAPTER 4Create unique covers with AIImagine that, thanks to ChatGPT’s help,
    you have finally finished your masterpiece. The plot, the characters, the emotions…everything
    has been perfectly designed and structured. But what about the cover? Had you
    forgotten? Remember that a good cover can make the difference between the success
    and failure of a book. However much we try to avoid it and however much it hurts,
    the truth is that we can’t help judging a book by its cover.Wouldn’t it be amazing
    if ChatGPT, after helping you write a real masterpiece in record time, could also
    help you with this important element? After all, a book without a cover is an
    unfinished book.However, as we saw in chapter two, ChatGPT can “only” provide
    ideas for your cover. It can’t design the cover itself. But what you can do is
    ask it to prepare a description or detailed prompt for each of these ideas, which
    you can then use to design your cover using other amazing AI tools.I’m talking
    about the AI image generating programs that have become so popular lately: DALL-E,
    Midjourney, Bing Image Creator…the list goes on.All you have to do is copy the
    cover description that ChatGPT produced for you, paste it into one of these image
    generation programs, and – as if by magic – you will have your cover ready in
    under five seconds.Not convinced by the first result? Go back to ChatGPT, tell
    it what you didn’t like and ask it to produce a new description. Or you can try
    using one of the other ideas it prepared. In addition, I recommend you repeat
    the process with different AI image generation programs. You might love one for
    designing a realistic cover and find that another does a better job for an illustrated
    children’s book.If at first, your attempts are more Picasso in his abstract phase
    than the professional cover you had in mind, don’t worry. Just like with ChatGPT,
    to get the best results out of these AI image generation programs, you need a
    little practice.Remember, AI is just a tool: a means to an end. You are the one
    who gives it direction, meaning and purpose. As such, don’t be afraid to experiment,
    try different combinations, think outside the box. Be brave! Feel proud of every
    Picasso painting that comes your way. Because each of them gets you closer to
    that perfect cover for your book.'
