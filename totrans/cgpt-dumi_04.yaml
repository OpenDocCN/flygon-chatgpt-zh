    a generative AI model. Difficulties in the complexity of cues and nuances in text-based
    prompts are why some organizations have a prompt engineering job role. Prompt
    engineering is the act of crafting an input, which is a deed borne partly of art

    in the input (called the prompt) in a natural-language format, rather than entering
    explicit instructions via computer code. Prompt engineers can be trained AI professionals
    or people who possess sufficient intuitive intelligence or skills transferrable
    to crafting prompts that solicit the desired outputs. One example of a transferrable
    skill is a journalist’s ability to tease out the answers they seek in an interview

    say 4000 tokens, the response you get will be cut off at 97 tokens, even if that’s
    mid-sentence.

    plan using combined or serial prompting in ChatGPT. This technique uses multiple
    prompts to guide ChatGPT through a more complex thought process. You can use multiple
    prompts as a single input, such as telling ChatGPT it's a team consisting of several
    members with different roles, all of whom are to answer the one prompt you entered.
    Or you can use multiple prompts in a sequence in which the output of one becomes
    the input of the next. In this case, each response builds on the prompt that you
    just entered and the prompts you entered earlier. This type of a prompt chain
    forms organically, unless you stop ChatGPT from considering earlier prompts in
    its responses by starting a new chat.
