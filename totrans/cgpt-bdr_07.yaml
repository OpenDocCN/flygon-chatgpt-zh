- en: Fear of the unknown is a common reason why humans are averse to the invention
    of new technology. It’s normal for us to be afraid or apprehensive when faced
    with the prospect or reality of something unfamiliar. This is especially true
    for emerging tech like Artificial Intelligence, and we can see from the world’s
    reactions to the emergence of ChatGPT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    people associate AI with the portrayal of dystopian science fiction movies. They
    are afraid of a world where there would be a loss of control and humans would
    be at the mercy of robots.

    invention of ChatGPT, advancements in AI are clearly accelerating, and many are
    finding it hard to keep up. This creates overwhelming feelings and a sense of
    being left behind. It also triggers worries about the unknown risks associated
    with new, rising technologies.

    data to make predictions – similar to the human brain. The key difference between
    AI and the human brain is that the latter makes decisions from a subjective point

    what it has learned.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    It is clear from the kind of discussions happening on the internet since the viral
    launch of ChatGPT. Many now believe AI will suddenly push them out of the job
    market into long-term unemployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in time as more tasks are automated. AI will become more efficient as it improves;
    it can perform certain tasks better than humans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    process it within seconds, and use it to make predictions and suggestions on the
    best course of action. Obviously, a human can’t do this on the same scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    In most cases, it simply means that AI will assist human workers with more tasks,
    giving them more time to focus on the creative aspects of work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make predictions and decisions. Overall, you won’t have to worry about the everyday
    tasks you currently do.
  prefs: []

    specializing your skills and becoming better at what you learned through education
    and experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    anymore. Instead, individuals will review AI-generated suggestions based on gathered
    and processed data.

    noted earlier, artificial intelligence uses data and algorithms designed by humans.
    This makes it predisposed to human biases. The best way to counter this is for
    developers to carefully curate and analyze AI data and constantly monitor and
    improve the algorithm to reduce bias and ensure fairness as much as possible.
