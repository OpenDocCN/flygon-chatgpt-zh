    from technology and limits their use of electronic devices. This can include turning
    off notifications, putting away smartphones, and avoiding social media and other
    forms of digital communication. The goal of a digital detox is to break away from
    the constant flow of information and distractions that technology can provide
    and to give our minds and bodies a much-needed break. It allows us to focus on
    the present moment and connect with the world around us in a deeper and more meaningful
    way. A digital detox can take many forms, from a short break of a few hours to
    a longer period of time, such as a weekend or even a week or more. It is a personalized
    process that can be tailored to suit an individual's needs, preferences, and lifestyle.

    have a lot of fun doing it.'

    prefer sunshine and lots of water. Different types of herbs can be grown in different
    climates so make sure you research what kind will work best for your area.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    indoors or outdoors? If you decide on indoor plants, don’t worry- there are plenty
    of options available that are perfect for apartments without a lot of space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now when it comes to actually planting the herbs, there are three main things
    to keep in mind: soil type and quality; light availability; and temperature requirements.
    Let’s look at soil first. You want your soil loose enough so air circulates around
    the roots but also packed enough that it holds moisture well – not too much though
    because soggy roots will rot quickly!'
  prefs: []

    some research as certain types may require more or less sun depending on their
    hardiness level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    however some such as mint thrive even during cooler temperatures if they have
    protection from frosty conditions!

    icon in the top right corner of the browser to open the popup and block or unblock
    the current tab. You can also click on the "Options" link to open the options
    page and add websites to the list of distracting websites.

- en: So, simple as that we have a working chrome extension, you can copy and paste
    this code and try it out for yourself. Now we could ask it for instructions on
    how to add more features to it or how to package and upload it to the extension
    marketplace, you could charge for it, or give away a limited free version and
    get people to “upgrade” for pro functionality (and get chatGPT to add it too!)

    you could easily ask **“Re-write the extension to work on Firefox”, “safari”**
    or any other browser that supports extensions and put them on that marketplace
    too.

    love to hear stories of how people come up with different features on top of this
    and create different income streams.
