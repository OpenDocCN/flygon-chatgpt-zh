    to make, do you continue with the old version of the chat AI, or do you opt in
    to the new model and see what it can do for you? Well, before you make a decision
    on that, you should be aware that GPT 4 has a monthly subscription cost whereas
    GPT 3.5 costs nothing, and there are no limits to the number of questions you
    can ask or answers you can receive. With that being said, GPT 4 does represent
    the the latest evolution of AI since ChatGPT was first introduced to the general
    public, and some of the advanced features it has include the guarantee that you
    will always be able to get logged in, even if the free version is completely full.
    Not only that, but it can also produce longer answers to your prompts and queries.
