- en: A ChatGPT prompt is the initial input or instruction provided to the AI model
    to begin a conversation or generate a response. It serves as a starting point
    for the AI system to understand the context and generate a relevant reply. The
    prompt can be a question, a statement, or any text that sets the direction for
    the conversation. The quality and clarity of the prompt significantly influence
    the output generated by ChatGPT.
