  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IF YOU'RE A student, you'll likely want to take advantage of the many ways that
    ChatGPT offers to simplify, enliven, and turbocharge your learning. This chapter
    shows you how to craft prompts to enlist ChatGPT's help with language practice,
    understanding and executing homework, kick-starting your writing assignments,
    and polishing your prose—not to mention drafting essays and theses and creating
    practice tests targeting your weak areas.

    to make sure that your child is using it sensibly and effectively—and not relying
    on it too much.  ## Before We Begin, a Short Homily'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're a student, you won't need me to tell you that ChatGPT and other generative
    AI tools are a point of contention between students and teachers at present. Understandably
    enough, students want to leverage this exciting new technology to get their schoolwork
    done faster, better, and more easily. Whereas teachers—also quite understandably—want
    students to put in at least the traditional amount of thought, effort, and research
    to ensure that they actually benefit from their courses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I mentioned in [Chapter 11](c11.xhtml), assignments are a particular flashpoint.
    For the teacher, an assignment you submit should prove that you have studied the
    material; you understand it; and you can write about it, preferably in your own
    voice. For you, the assignment should be a challenge (if it's not a challenge,
    what's the point?) that enables you to demonstrate your developing abilities,
    your mastery of the material, and your skill in writing to target.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pasting the assignment's topic into ChatGPT and submitting the result as if
    it were your own work will do neither you nor your teacher any good. The teacher
    is likely to notice that the assignment is not written in your voice; the teacher
    may also spot other clues that the assignment was written by AI, either simply
    by reading the text or by inputting it into an automated checker. If so, you and
    your teacher will no doubt have an uncomfortable conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid such awkwardness, be clear what your school's policy is on students
    using generative AI in general and what your teacher expects for each specific
    assignment. Most likely, your teacher will spell these things out to you and your
    classmates; but if not, or if the instructions are not clear, ask for an explanation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, your teachers might encourage you to use AI to research topics,
    to get help if you''re stuck on your homework, and to create practice tests. They
    might even suggest you use AI to help develop the outline for an assignment and
    to make sure that your writing is on topic. But they will likely insist that any
    work you submit as original must genuinely be your own output.  ## Practice Another
    Language'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're learning another language, ChatGPT can be a great help in several
    ways, including translating text, explaining grammar, demonstrating how to construct
    sentences, and expanding your vocabulary. ChatGPT can also help you with pronunciation
    and conversation, although its text-based nature is more of a limitation for these
    areas.

    battles of the American Civil War. Create 10 multiple-choice questions with four
    answers each, labeled A, B, C, and D. Do not show me these questions at first.
    Ask me one question at a time and wait for me to answer. I will answer A, B, C,
    or D to show my choice. Tell me whether my answer is correct or incorrect, and
    then ask the next question. At the end of the test, show me a summary of correct
    and incorrect answers. Where my answer was incorrect, indicate the correct answer.**'

    is necessary, because otherwise ChatGPT shows you the full list of questions before
    starting the test.
