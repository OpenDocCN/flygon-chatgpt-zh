  zh: 介绍
- en: Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the term used to describe the online
    purchasing and selling of products and services. The emergence of the internet
    and digital technology has altered the retail environment, opening up new channels
    for companies to connect with customers and enabling people to simply purchase
    from home. With more people resorting to online shopping for a range of goods,
    from groceries and home basics to apparel and gadgets, the ecommerce business
    has expanded quickly in recent years. Traditional brick-and-mortar businesses
    have to adjust to the shifting industry by creating their own online presence
    since ecommerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba have become well-known
    brands.

  zh: 全球电子商务市场概况
- en: The ecommerce market has been growing steadily over the past few years and is
    expected to continue its upward trajectory in the foreseeable future. According
    to data from eMarketer, global ecommerce sales amounted to $4.2 trillion in 2020,
    representing a 27.6% increase from the previous year, and it became $5.2 trillion
    and expected to grow at a rate of 56% till 2026 up to $8 trillion approximately.
    Ecommerce sales are expected to reach $6.4 trillion by 2024, with ecommerce accounting
    for 21.8% of total retail sales worldwide. The ecommerce market is dominated by
    a few major players, including Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay. Amazon is the largest
    ecommerce retailer in the world, accounting for around 38% of all ecommerce sales
    in the US and 14% globally. Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China
    and the second largest in the world, accounting for 55% of all online retail sales
    in China. eBay, while not as large as Amazon or Alibaba, is still a major player

  zh: 过去几年，电子商务市场一直稳步增长，并预计在可预见的未来将继续上升。根据eMarketer的数据，2020年全球电子商务销售额达到4.2万亿美元，比上一年增长了27.6%，并预计到2026年将达到5.2万亿美元，预计以56%的速度增长至约8万亿美元。预计到2024年，电子商务销售额将达到6.4万亿美元，电子商务将占全球零售总额的21.8%。电子商务市场由少数几家主要参与者主导，包括亚马逊、阿里巴巴和eBay。亚马逊是全球最大的电子商务零售商，占美国约38%的电子商务销售额和全球14%。阿里巴巴是中国最大的电子商务公司，也是全球第二大，占中国55%的所有在线零售额。eBay虽然不如亚马逊或阿里巴巴那么大，但在电子商务市场仍是一家重要参与者，拥有超过1.85亿活跃买家和15亿个上市商品。
- en: While these major players dominate the ecommerce market, there is still room
    for smaller businesses to carve out a niche and succeed. The rise of social media
    and influencer marketing has enabled smaller businesses to reach customers and
    build brand awareness without the need for a large advertising budget. In addition,
    the growth of mobile commerce and the increasing availability of affordable ecommerce
    platforms have made it easier for businesses of all sizes to set up an online
    store and reach a global audience.
