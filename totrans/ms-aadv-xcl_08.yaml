    Filtering allows us to display only the rows of information that meet specific
    criteria, making it easier to analyze and work with large datasets. We will learn
    about different types of filters, including the AutoFilter feature, number, text,
    and date filters, as well as the advanced filtering capabilities of Excel. Additionally,
    we will discover how to filter for unique records in a list. By the end of this
    chapter, readers will have a clear understanding of how to effectively use filters
    in Excel to extract and manipulate data based on specific criteria.

    and admin departments from north and south region who earns between 7000-12000
    or 15000-20000 are displayed, auto filter will not serve the purpose. This is
    because one number filter cannot be applied over another in Auto Filter. However,
    the above query requires us to do just the same on salary field. So, to solve
    this query, we may have to use Advanced-Filter.

    The Advanced Filter command filters your list in place, as Auto Filter does, but
    it does not display dropdown lists for columns. Instead, you have to select the

    and select the Criteria Range and in output range type the cell address where
    you want to display the output. It is optional.

- en: Filtering a database in Excel allows us to extract specific information based
    on criteria we define. In this chapter, we learned about AutoFilter, number/text/date
    filters, and advanced filtering. We also explored filtering for unique records.
    By mastering these techniques, we can efficiently analyze data and make informed
    decisions. In the next chapter, we will delve into the powerful capabilities of
    sorting data in Excel.
