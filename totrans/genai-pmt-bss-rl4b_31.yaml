- en: You can employ the AI system in your application after you are happy with its
    performance. Deploying the AI system involves making the system available for
    use by end-users. This can include integrating the system into an existing product
    or service or creating a new one based on the AI system.Before deploying the system,
    it is essential to ensure it is stable, reliable, and secure. This can involve
    stress-testing the system to ensure it can handle large traffic volumes and implementing
    security measures to protect against unauthorized access or attacks.Deployment
    should be controlled and gradual to ensure issues or bugs are caught early and
    addressed before they become widespread. This can involve initially releasing
    the system to a small group of users and then gradually scaling up to a more extensive
    user base.Ongoing monitoring and maintenance are also crucial after deployment
    to ensure that the system continues to perform as expected and to address any
    issues or bugs that may arise. This can involve monitoring user feedback, performance
    metrics, and other data to identify areas for improvement.Deploying the AI system
