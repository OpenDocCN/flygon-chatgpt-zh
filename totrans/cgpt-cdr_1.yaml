- en: OpenAI has created an advanced language model known as ChatGPT. This model is
    able to generate text that seems to have been written by humans based on a massive
    body of data. Its design enables it to execute a broad variety of natural language
    processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, question answering,
    and code creation. It was trained on a vast dataset of text taken from the internet,
    and this allowed it to accomplish these tasks. The term "Chat Generative Pretrained
    Transformer" (abbreviated as "ChatGPT") was given to this system because of its
    capacity to produce text as well as its implementation of the Transformer architecture,
    which is a subclass of deep neural networks.
