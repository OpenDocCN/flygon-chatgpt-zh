    make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute
    different blocks of code depending on the outcome of a logical expression. In
    this chapter, we will focus on two commonly used conditional statements in VBA:
    Select Case and If...End If.'

    a block of code if the condition is true. It can also be combined with “ElseIf”
    and “Else” clauses to handle multiple conditions. Here is an example of the basic
    syntax for the “If...End If” statement:'

    other control structures like loops and can be used in combination with other
    statements and keywords to create more complex logic in your VBA code.

    Case statement then evaluates the input and displays a corresponding message based
    on the selected fruit. If the fruit is “apple”, it displays a message about it
    being a healthy choice. If it’s “banana”, it mentions its potassium content. If
    it is “orange” or “mandarin”, it highlights the citrus goodness. For any other
    input, it displays a generic message.

    ElseIf statement, the Select Case statement evaluates an expression only once,

- en: In this chapter, we explored the differences between Select Case and If...End
    If statements in VBA. We learned that Select Case is a useful alternative when
    you have multiple conditions to evaluate against a single expression. It simplifies
    your code and improves readability. However, If...End If statements are more appropriate
    when you have distinct and unrelated conditions to consider.
