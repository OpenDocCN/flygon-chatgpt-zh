    for this book. My hope is that readers will find this a useful guide to using
    ChatGPT to generate content of their own, and that it will simultaneously elucidate
    some of the capabilities and limitations of the ChatGPT technology. So here’s
    a travelog of my chats with ChatGPT.

  zh: 在这一章中，我将解释我是如何与ChatGPT合作生成本书内容的。我希望读者会发现这是一个有用的使用ChatGPT生成自己内容的指南，并且它将同时阐明ChatGPT技术的一些能力和局限性。所以这里是我与ChatGPT的聊天记录。
- en: Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is exceptionally polite and writes very
    clean, grammatically correct prose. I have to admit that I found this extremely
    refreshing relative to almost all other content on the Internet. I would even
    encourage my elderly parents to interact with it because they would find it friendly,
    knowledgeable, and courteous.

  zh: 让我首先说一下，ChatGPT非常有礼貌，写的文风非常清晰，语法正确。我不得不承认，相对于互联网上几乎所有其他内容来说，我觉得这非常令人耳目一新。我甚至会鼓励我的年迈父母与之交流，因为他们会觉得它友好、知识渊博且有礼貌。
- en: I’ll begin with a note about the cover art for the book and the illustrations,
    all of which were generated using AI text-to-image generation systems. I used
    NightCafe.com with the Stable Diffusion algorithm to generate each of the illustrations.
    In each case, I began by feeding text copied directly from the manuscript into
    the algorithm prompt to generate a set of four trial images. I then used my human
    sensibilities to decide which image to use at each point in the book, and in some
    cases even chose to use all four of the generated images because the vignette
    of four images was interesting in its own right. For many of the illustrations,
    this approach didn’t work because text-to-image generation systems are not always
    great at creating an image that depicts a concept rather than a physical object.
    As a result, for some of the images, I intervened and asked for a specific object
    or representation to illustrate some part of each chapter.

  zh: 我将从书籍封面艺术和插图开始讲起，所有这些都是使用AI文本到图像生成系统生成的。我使用了稳定扩散算法的NightCafe.com生成了每一幅插图。在每种情况下，我都是通过直接从手稿中复制的文本输入算法提示来生成一组四幅试验图像。然后，我用我的人类感知来决定在书中的每个地方使用哪张图像，有时甚至选择使用所有四张生成的图像，因为四张图像的小插图本身也很有趣。对于许多插图来说，这种方法并不奏效，因为文本到图像生成系统并不总是擅长创建描绘概念而不是物理对象的图像。因此，对于一些图像，我干预并要求特定的对象或代表以说明每个章节的某个部分。
- en: 'I made a few observations during the image generation process: First, most
    humans generated in the process are creepy. It was better to ask for “cuneiform
    tablets” than for “people gathered around cuneiform tablets.” I also noted that
    the tablets thus represented tended to contain blocks or squiggles that were reminiscent
    of cuneiform, rather than actually containing any cuneiform.'

  zh: 在图像生成过程中，我做了一些观察：首先，大多数生成的人类都很吓人。要求“楔形文字片”要比要求“人们聚集在楔形文字片周围”更好。我还注意到，这样代表的片子往往包含类似楔形文字的块或曲线，而不是实际包含任何楔形文字。

- en: 'My second observation about the humans generated by the Stable Diffusion algorithm
    (and I believe this is true of most of the text-to-image systems right now), they
    were generally Caucasian, with males being represented in a variety of ages, but
    females generally looking like 20-somethings. This is not a criticism of the algorithms:
    They are a representation of the information that is presented on the Internet,
    not a representation of how we would like the world to be. I did not experiment
    much with generating people of different ethnicities, genders and ages since they
    were mostly pretty creepy anyway. As a matter of image-generating utility, it
    is likely that better control over what people look like and what demographics
    they represent will be developed in text-to-image tools in the near future. To
    be fair, the image of Tom and Emily that I chose from my four candidates in Chapter
    7 did naturally represent Emily as non-white, so the algorithms are not completely
    ignorant of the composition of the world’s population.'

  zh: 我对稳定扩散算法生成的人类的第二个观察（我相信这对现在大多数文本到图像系统都是真实的），他们通常是白种人，男性代表各个年龄段，但女性通常看起来像20多岁。这并不是对算法的批评：它们是对互联网上呈现的信息的一种表现，而不是对我们希望世界变成什么样的表现。我没有尝试生成不同种族、性别和年龄的人，因为它们大多看起来很可怕。从图像生成的实用性来看，未来文本到图像工具可能会更好地控制人们的外观和代表的人口统计数据。公平地说，我在第7章从我的四个候选人中选择的汤姆和艾米丽的图像自然地将艾米丽描绘为非白种人，所以这些算法并不完全无视世界人口的构成。
- en: One other minor note, astute readers may notice that the Story of Arwen, the
    Master Wordsmith, seems a bit “Lord-of-the-Rings-ish.” That is because, for the
    sake of exploring the writing style range of ChatGPT, I asked ChatGPT to write
    the story in the style of JRR Tolkein. I did the same with the image generation
    process, resulting in some hilariously Hobbit-like depictions of Arwen. The image
    I chose has some very interesting characteristics. For example, Arwen’s hair is
    a mixture between a hood and long hair, a neat trick of shape, texture and shading
    pulled off by Stable Diffusion.

  zh: 另一个小提示，敏锐的读者可能会注意到，大师文字匠阿温的故事似乎有点“魔戒风格”。这是因为，为了探索ChatGPT的写作风格范围，我要求ChatGPT以JRR托尔金的风格写这个故事。我在图像生成过程中也做了同样的事情，结果是一些滑稽的霍比特式的阿温形象。我选择的图像具有一些非常有趣的特点。例如，阿温的头发是帽子和长发的混合物，这是由稳定扩散实现的形状、质地和阴影的巧妙技巧。

    to expand on the first bullet point from its original summary of the book. I am
    also asking for 2000 words, thinking this is a decent size for a single, short-ish
    book chapter. It’s not clear to me that ChatGPT was at all impacted by my request
    for 2000 words.
  id: totrans-53

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这里有几点需要注意。战略上，我要求ChatGPT扩展其对书籍原始摘要的第一个要点。我还要求2000字，认为这对于一个单独、相对短的书籍章节来说是一个体面的大小。对我来说ChatGPT是否受到我的要求2000字的影响并不清楚。
- en: 'The second thing to note is that I have given up on writing “like Bob Rogers,
    PhD” and have requested instead for ChatGPT to write in a “flowery, literary style
    with examples and anecdotes.” I found that the “flowery, literary style” resulted
    in ChatGPT generating more verbose output, and using more descriptive terms. This
    may have been my imagination, since we humans are easily victimized by the power
    of suggestion. The first chapter begins with “In the beginning, there was only
    the voice, the sound of human breath and tongue forming words, sharing stories
    and experiences,” which does sound flowery and literary to me. I wondered if I
    was second-order plagiarizing someone else through ChatGPT, so I searched parts
    of this sentence on the Internet. No solid hits came up, so I imagine that ChatGPT
    is generating new text by randomly selecting from aggregated statistical patterns
    and not just memorizing specific phrases. (This is consistent with how Transformer
    AI models, the technology behind ChatGPT, work in general: They don’t memorize
    specific phrases so much as associate probabilities of words following other words,
    based on very complex and nuanced patterns.)'
  id: totrans-54
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二点需要注意的是，我已经放弃了写“像鲍勃·罗杰斯博士”，而是要求ChatGPT以“花哨的、文学风格，带有例子和轶事”来写作。我发现“花哨的、文学风格”导致ChatGPT生成了更冗长的输出，并使用了更多的描述性术语。这可能是我的想象，因为我们人类很容易受到建议的影响。第一章以“起初，只有声音，人类呼吸和舌头形成词语的声音，分享故事和经历”开始，对我来说听起来很花哨和文学。我想知道我是否通过ChatGPT二次剽窃了别人，所以我在互联网上搜索了这句话的部分内容。没有找到确切的结果，所以我想ChatGPT是通过随机选择聚合统计模式而生成新文本，而不仅仅是记忆特定短语。（这与Transformer
    AI模型，即ChatGPT背后的技术，一般的工作方式一致：它们不是记忆特定短语，而是基于非常复杂和微妙的模式，关联单词跟随其他单词的概率。）
- en: Also, there is a parameter called Temperature in GPT-3, the language model under
    the hood of ChatGPT, that controls how far afield the generated language is allowed

    with this version of Chapter 1 was that it was still quite short and felt more
    like a detailed summary of a chapter, rather than the chapter itself. In order

    wanted to ask detailed questions and push ChatGPT to get into detail about things

    were left out by ChatGPT, even after I asked for more topics and details. For
    example, there is no discussion of the development of sign language for the hearing
    impaired, nor any interesting anecdotes about Helen Keller or Pedro Ponce de León,
    a 16th-century Spanish Benedictine monk who is credited on the Internet as one
    of the first to apply a formal sign language for communication by hearing impaired.
    I chose not to ask ChatGPT specifically about this, because it was my intent to
    have ChatGPT generate all of the content for the main part of the book. Adding
    my own questions would have been cheating, or at least constitute a different

    Ponce de León）的有趣轶事，他是一位16世纪西班牙本笃会修士，被认为是首位应用正式手语进行听障者交流的人之一。我选择不特别询问 ChatGPT

- en: Another interesting communication anecdote missing from ChatGPT’s narrative
    is the entire topic of encryption and secure communication. Historical examples
    like the use of Navajo code talkers in WWII, who encrypted their own native language
    to enable quick, encoded communication during the war would have made an interesting
    addition. Security and encrypted communication are also critical in the era of
    the Internet, given that no communication on the Internet is protected from prying
    eyes unless it is properly encrypted. This could have become an even more interesting
    topic in a book about communication and the impact of computing (AI) on its evolution
    since one of the biggest technical risks we face right now is the likelihood that
    quantum computing will someday make our current encryption methods (the most common
    of which is an algorithm called AES-256 encryption) obsolete. It turns out that
    a sufficiently powerful quantum algorithm can break AES-256 encryption within
    a reasonable amount of time. While some security alarmists are already saying
    that rogue nations have working quantum computers, I recently spoke to a quantum
    computing graduate student who thinks a “real” quantum computer of that scale
    is probably a decade off. This could have been an interesting point for ChatGPT
    to bring up, but it did not pick up the encryption thread in the story.

  zh: 另一个在ChatGPT的叙述中缺失的有趣的沟通轶事是加密和安全通信的整个话题。历史上的例子，比如二战中纳瓦霍密码通信员的使用，他们加密了自己的母语，以便在战争期间实现快速、编码的通信，这本应是一个有趣的补充。在互联网时代，安全和加密通信也至关重要，因为除非适当加密，否则互联网上的任何通信都无法避免被窥探。在关于通信和计算（人工智能）对其演变的影响的书籍中，这可能会成为一个更有趣的话题，因为我们目前面临的最大技术风险之一是量子计算有朝一日会使我们当前的加密方法（其中最常见的是一种名为AES-256加密的算法）过时。事实证明，一个足够强大的量子算法可以在合理的时间内破解AES-256加密。虽然一些安全警报人士已经表示，一些流氓国家已经拥有工作的量子计算机，但我最近与一位量子计算研究生交谈，他认为那种规模的“真正”量子计算机可能还需要十年的时间。这本应该是ChatGPT提出的一个有趣观点，但它没有在故事中继续探讨加密的线索。
- en: Finally, an interesting note about a topic that ChatGPT did not forget, and
    which in fact it seems to adore, is the invention of the printing press. Every
    time I asked about historical development of communication or creativity, regardless
    of what the context was, ChatGPT enthusiastically brought the conversation around
    to the development of the printing press. Of course, this is proper, since the
    invention of the printing press was a game changer for human communication, and
    probably a door-opener for broader communication and creativity among more average
    humans, but I suspect that it is reflecting that as a secondary effect of the
    fact that many documents have been written that mention the development of the
    printing press, and from a statistical point of view, ChatGPT is impressed by
    this. Parenthetically, I do hope ChatGPT is not too impressed with all the commentary
    of social media about various political figures in our current world. I would
    hate to think that future students will learn more about current shenanigans than
    about real historically important figures.

  zh: 最后，一个有趣的关于ChatGPT没有忘记的话题，实际上它似乎很喜欢的话题，是印刷术的发明。每当我询问关于沟通或创造力的历史发展时，无论背景是什么，ChatGPT都会热情地将对话引向印刷术的发展。当然，这是合适的，因为印刷术的发明对人类沟通产生了深远影响，可能也为更普通人之间更广泛的沟通和创造力打开了一扇门，但我怀疑这反映了一个事实，即许多文献提到了印刷术的发展，从统计学的角度看，ChatGPT对此印象深刻。顺便说一句，我希望ChatGPT不会对当前世界社交媒体上关于各种政治人物的评论过于印象深刻。我不希望未来的学生会更多地了解当前的恶作剧，而不是真正具有历史重要性的人物。
