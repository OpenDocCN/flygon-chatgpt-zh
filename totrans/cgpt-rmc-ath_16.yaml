    author voice and style.

    in one combined input and output conversation/chat and still recall the previous
    chat. This is because of “tokens”.

- en: What are OpenAI GPT tokens?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens are the basic unit that OpenAI GPT models (including ChatGPT) use to
    compute the length of a text. They are groups of characters, aligned with words
    used for natural language processing. The number of tokens needed to accept a
    prompt and respond to it in one single chat, depends on the number of characters
    and punctuation marks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are limits to how many tokens can be used in each question prompt and
    the response generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ChatGPT free model has an estimated maximum size of 4,096 tokens, which
    is equivalent to about 3,000 words for both your prompt and the response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GPT-4, available as the paid version of ChatGPT Plus, is capable of handling
    over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation,
    extended conversations, and document search and analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you wanted to prompt the system with a writing sample of an entire chapter
    one, for example, then this could be 4,000 words or more and you would need ChatGPT-4
    to handle the prompt and generate a 4,000 word or longer response. This is one
    of the main reasons why I would recommend that you upgrade to ChatGPT-Plus if
    you wish to use this AI to support your creative writing.
