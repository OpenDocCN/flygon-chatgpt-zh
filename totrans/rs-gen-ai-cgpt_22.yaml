- en: A **neural language model** (**NLM**) called ChatGPT has been developed to carry
    out a variety of activities, including problem-solving. In this experiment, we
    intended to test ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills by resolving common mathematical
    issues — not simple computational ones that Google can handle, like “how many
    millimetre in 100 m,” but ones that truly show/tell me how to solve a problem.
    Throughout the challenge, we watched ChatGPT’s progress and outcomes and evaluated
    its performance to learn more about its capacity for problem-solving. This study
    sheds important light on ChatGPT’s potential as a tool for tackling challenging
    issues.

- en: The potential of ChatGPT to help with problem-solving is one of its most effective
    uses. ChatGPT can give an alternative viewpoint and answers to complicated problems
    that a person would not have thought of. This is especially beneficial in disciplines
    like mathematical models, writing neural networks and formulae where complicated
    issues call for a thorough comprehension of technical ideas. By making use of
    the large body of knowledge it has been educated on, ChatGPT may provide insightful
    analysis and Students in making significant advances in their domains.
