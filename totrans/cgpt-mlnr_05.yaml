    type of questions, as well as complexity level and use it to create as many questions/quizzes
    as you need, whether you’re a teacher, tutor or a parent, this can be a godsend.

    based around the same 4 choices so some manual curation is required**)

    For those that haven’t, it’s a classic interview question that software developers
    are asked, it’s pretty entry level however it’s quite easy to get it wrong if
    you’re not specific.

    It checks if the current number is divisible by 15 first. If it's true, it prints
    "fizzbuzz". If it's not, then it checks if the current number is divisible by
    3 , If it's true, it prints "fizz". Then, it checks if the current number is divisible
    by 5, If it's true it prints "buzz". If none of the conditions are met, it prints
    the current number.

- en: This was a nice clean implementation (the key part people mostly fail at is
    putting the “%15” as the first step) and the added comments even though we didn't
    ask for them are a nice touch. If you want to run the program but are not sure
    how, just ask chatGPT, **“How do I run this”. **
