    They are AI systems designed to understand, generate, and interact with human
    language, and their prowess is rooted in a special deep learning[¹](#ftn1a) architecture
    known as Transformers, which were introduced in 2017\. Transformers employ a unique
    attention mechanism, enabling them to discern the relevance of words within an
    input sentence when generating an output sentence.

  zh: 语言模型是人工智能（AI）中的一项突破性创新。它们是设计用于理解、生成和与人类语言交互的AI系统，其实力根植于一种称为变压器的特殊深度学习[¹](#ftn1a)架构，该架构于2017年引入。变压器采用独特的注意机制，使其能够在生成输出句子时辨别输入句子中单词的相关性。
- en: Leveraging this pioneering approach, OpenAI, initially established as a non-profit
    AI research laboratory[²](#ftn2a) in the US, launched the first Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer (GPT-1) in 2018 with 117 million parameters[³](#ftn3a). The GPT-1
    model employed a simplified left-to-right version of the Transformer architecture,
    which enabled it to generate the next word in a text sequence based on the context
    of the preceding words.

- en: Throughout its training process, the model worked to predict the subsequent
    word in a sentence, given a specific lookback window of previous words and their
    respective degrees of importance for the new word. It compared this prediction
    with the actual next word in reference texts from its dataset of 7000 books (BooksCorpus),
    making adjustments to its internal mechanisms whenever discrepancies were identified.
    When the predictions were accurate, no adjustments were needed. BooksCorpus was
    chosen partly because the long passages of continuous text helped the model learn
    to handle long-range dependencies.

    GPT-2 utilized a larger training dataset of 8 million web pages or 40GB of text,

    learning[⁶](#ftn6a) and text generation. The model can create high-quality synthetic
    text based on any given input, adapting to the style and content seamlessly, allowing
    for coherent and realistic text continuations on user-chosen topics. GPT-2 also
    outperforms GPT-1 in other text generation tasks like translation and summarization,
    as well as in text understanding tasks like question answering and reading comprehension.

- en: OpenAI’s GPT models, notably GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, underwent a major upgrade
    in June 2023, allowing them to interact with external tools via the generation
    of API function calls. Before delving deeper, it’s essential to draw a clear distinction
    between plugins and this new feature. The previous subchapter extensively discussed
    plugins, which are specific enhancements that need to be officially registered
    with OpenAI. Once registered, these plugins become extensions of ChatGPT-4, available
    to the ChatGPT user community.

    to enable the cooperation of GPT models with any enterprise application. Examples
    are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management),
    and SCM (Supply chain Management) systems. Expanding their reach further, GPT
    models can also interface with enterprise-specific search engines, intranet sites,
    databases, and specialized ML-models ensuring a seamless blend with organizational
    IT-ecosystems.

    generate specific function calls instead of natural language when certain conditions
    are met. These models are skilled to check these conditions on each user input
    and, if met, create the respective function calls that match the expected format.
    The main program simply needs to execute the function call and handle its results,
    which could involve another prompt to a GPT model to provide a summary in natural
    language, which then could be displayed to the user.

    GPT-4 model. This new iteration stands out with its extensive 128k context window,
    allowing it to process information equivalent to over 300 pages of text at once.
    It is updated with world events knowledge until April 2023 and has been optimized
    for cost, with input and output tokens being significantly cheaper than its predecessor.
    In terms of functionality, GPT-4 Turbo enables the execution of multiple functions
    from a single prompt and claims further accuracy improvements in following instructions,
    especially beneficial for developers needing structured outputs like JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation). An additional feature is the ability to generate consistent
