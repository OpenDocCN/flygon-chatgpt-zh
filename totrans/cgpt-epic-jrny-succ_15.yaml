    launched two short-range ballistic missiles, which landed in the sea between the
    Korean Peninsula and Japan, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
    The missiles were launched from North Korea’s Sunan area, JCS said, and were fired
    in the early morning on Wednesday local time. After flying about 550 kilometers
    each, the missiles landed in the sea, it added. “The detailed specifications of
    these missiles are being analyzed by intelligence authorities of South Korean
    and the US,” JCS said. Japan’s government also described the two missiles in a
    statement, saying that they fell outside of its exclusive economic zone. The launches
    follow a period of heightened tensions on the peninsula."'
