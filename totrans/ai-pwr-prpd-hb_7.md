## 从家居维修到商业帝国：在 ChatGPT 的帮助下

从前，有一个名叫 Khaled 的男子，拥有一家专门从事空调、电气工程、管道和基本油漆的小型家居维修业务。然而，Khaled 渴望将他的业务扩展到家居维护之外，意识到这个行业竞争激烈且利润空间低。为了实现他的目标，Khaled 最初寻求了管理顾问的服务，这既昂贵又耗时，因为他不得不向顾问介绍他的业务运营情况。

然后，Khaled 想到了一个绝妙的主意。他发现了由 OpenAI 开发的大型语言模型 ChatGPT，并开始利用它作为分析他的业务和获取与业务相关知识的快速且经济有效的方法。通过向 ChatGPT 提问，Khaled 获得了宝贵的见解和建议，帮助他发展公司。在 ChatGPT 的帮助下，Khaled 发现了新的市场机会，简化了运营，并提高了盈利能力。

Khaled 对于能够通过 ChatGPT 的帮助快速且经济地获得新知识和见解感到兴奋。多亏了 ChatGPT，Khaled 的业务蓬勃发展，使他成为一名成功的企业家。

## Khaled 的探索之旅始于园林景观业务

Khaled 认为园艺景观可能是一个不错的生意。这也是一个需要熟练工人的承包业务，以及让他们在正确的时间用正确的材料完成工作的物流。除此之外，Khaled 对园艺景观并不很了解，所以他去找 ChatGPT 并问道：

#### 提示 - 关于园艺景观：

```
tell me about the landscaping business
```

#### 输出 - 关于园艺景观

```
The landscaping business involves designing, installing, and maintaining outdoor spaces such as lawns, gardens, parks, and other green spaces. Landscaping businesses can offer a range of services, including:

Landscape design: This involves creating a plan for the outdoor space, which may include selecting plants, hardscape features, and outdoor structures such as patios or decks. Landscape installation: This involves actually building and installing the elements of the landscape design, including plants, trees, flowers, rocks, and other decorative features. Lawn care: This involves mowing, fertilizing, and otherwise maintaining the lawn to keep it healthy and attractive. Irrigation: This involves installing and maintaining a system of sprinklers or other watering systems to keep the landscape properly hydrated. Tree care: This involves pruning, trimming, and otherwise maintaining trees on the property to keep them healthy and attractive. Hardscaping: This involves installing features such as walkways, retaining walls, outdoor kitchens, and other structures that are made from non-living materials. Landscaping businesses can serve a variety of clients, including homeowners, businesses, parks, and government agencies. The work can be physically demanding, requiring knowledge of plants, irrigation systems, and other landscaping equipment. Some landscaping businesses specialize in certain types of landscapes, such as water features or sustainable design, while others offer a more general range of services.

从 ChatGPT 给出的描述来看，Khaled 很可能支持一个园艺景观业务。他需要为团队增加一些新技能，因此他需要找出他在员工方面需要什么。

#### 提示 - 员工：

```
what do i need in terms of staff to service a small area ?
```

#### 输出 - 员工

```
The number of staff required to service a small area in the landscaping business will depend on the size and complexity of the projects being undertaken, as well as the number of clients you have and the level of demand for your services. Here are some general guidelines:

Owner/Operator: For a small landscaping business serving a limited area, it may be possible for the owner/operator to handle most or all of the work themselves, at least in the beginning. Additional staff: As the business grows and more work comes in, it may be necessary to hire additional staff, such as a part-time or full-time landscaper or maintenance worker. The number of staff required will depend on the amount of work that needs to be done and the level of expertise needed for each task. Contractors: In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to hire independent contractors for specific tasks, such as tree trimming or irrigation system installation, rather than hiring full-time employees. This allows you to bring in specialized expertise on an as-needed basis. In addition to staff, you will need to invest in tools and equipment, such as lawnmowers, shovels, rakes, and other landscaping tools. You may also need to invest in a vehicle to transport equipment and supplies to job sites. It's important to carefully plan and budget for these expenses as you grow your business.
```

这是一个很长的回答，Khaled 没有时间阅读。因此，他这样提示 ChatGPT：

#### 提示 - 摘要：

```
summarize into bullet points
```

#### 输出 - 摘要

```
Sure, here is a summary in bullet points:

For a small area, the owner/operator can handle most or all of the work themselves. As the business grows, additional staff may be necessary. The number of staff required will depend on the amount of work and the level of expertise needed for each task. Independent contractors may be hired for specific tasks. Equipment such as lawnmowers, shovels, and vehicles will also be necessary. Planning and budgeting for expenses is important as the business grows.
```

好吧，园艺景观并不是很有趣，看起来需要额外的时间。让我们调查另一个业务，也许向 ChatGPT 寻求想法。

```

#### 提示 - 共同点和不同点：

```
what is common to the below busineesses and what is unique to them :

 Plumbing Services
 Carpentry Services
 Painting and Decorating Services
 Transportation and Logistics Services
 Store Management for Building Materials
 Engineering Consulting Services
```

#### 输出 - 共同点和不同点

```
Common:

They all provide services related to building construction or maintenance. They all require a certain level of technical expertise and specialized skills. They all require physical labor and may involve working with heavy equipment or tools. They all have to comply with local regulations, building codes, and safety standards. They all require good communication skills to interact with clients, suppliers, and contractors. Unique:

Plumbing Services involve the installation, repair, and maintenance of water and sewage systems in buildings. Carpentry Services involve the design, fabrication, and installation of wooden structures and fixtures in buildings. Painting and Decorating Services involve the application of paint, wallpaper, and other decorative materials to buildings' interior and exterior surfaces. Transportation and Logistics Services involve the movement of goods and materials from one place to another. Store Management for Building Materials involves the management of inventory, sales, and customer service in retail or wholesale stores that sell building materials and supplies. Engineering Consulting Services involve the provision of technical advice, design, and project management services related to building construction and infrastructure development.
```

我们还有六个业务剩下。是否可能将其中任何一个结合起来以实现更好的协同效应？

#### 提示 - 结合：

```
which of these businesses make sense in being combined together ? 
```

#### 输出 - 结合

```
Transportation and Logistics Services can be combined with Store Management for Building Materials. This is because a company that provides transportation and logistics services can also manage the inventory and sales of building materials and supplies, which can be a complementary service to their core business. Engineering Consulting Services can be combined with Plumbing Services, Carpentry Services, Painting and Decorating Services, and HVAC Services and Installations. This is because an engineering consulting firm can provide technical support and advice to these services, which can help improve the quality and efficiency of their work. However, it's important to note that combining businesses should be done with careful consideration and planning. Each business should have a clear value proposition and should not dilute the core competencies of the other business. Additionally, each business should have a clear target market and customer base, and combining businesses should not lead to a confusing or diluted brand identity.
```

将运输和物流服务与建筑材料店管理结合起来是非常有意义的。

此外，将工程咨询服务与管道服务、木工服务、油漆和装饰服务以及暖通空调服务和安装结合起来有助于保持质量，并为我们的客户提供一站式购物的设置。

如果客户决定从我们这里采购建筑材料，这两个业务将很好地协同工作。

让我们看看如果将所有业务结合起来会发生什么，以及我们将得到什么样的组织结构：

#### 提示 - 将所有业务结合起来和组织结构：

```
combine Transportation and Logistics Services can be combined with Store Management for Building Materials and Engineering Consulting Services can be combined with Plumbing Services, Carpentry Services, Painting and Decorating Services, and HVAC Services and Installations and suggest to me an organization structure to handle the new combined business
```

#### 输出 - 将所有业务结合起来和组织结构

```
Combining Transportation and Logistics Services with Store Management for Building Materials and Engineering Consulting Services with Plumbing Services, Carpentry Services, Painting and Decorating Services, and HVAC Services and Installations would create a comprehensive construction and maintenance services company. The combined business can offer a complete range of services to contractors, builders, homeowners, and businesses, including transportation, logistics, warehousing, inventory management, sales, customer support, engineering consulting, and technical services. Here's a suggested organizational structure for this new combined business:

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) - responsible for overall strategy and direction of the company
Chief Operating Officer (COO) - responsible for day-to-day operations of the company
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - responsible for financial management, budgeting, and forecasting
Sales and Marketing Director - responsible for sales and marketing strategies, customer relationship management, and advertising campaigns
Logistics Director - responsible for transportation and logistics operations, warehouse management, and inventory control
Store Manager - responsible for store operations, inventory management, and customer service
Engineering Director - responsible for engineering consulting services, project management, and technical support
Service Manager - responsible for plumbing, carpentry, painting, decorating, and HVAC services and installations
Purchasing Manager - responsible for procurement of building materials and supplies, negotiating contracts with suppliers, and managing supplier relationships
Human Resources Manager - responsible for recruitment, training, and development of employees, and ensuring compliance with employment laws and regulations
The key advantage of this organizational structure is that it allows for a clear separation of responsibilities and decision-making authority. The COO can oversee day-to-day operations of all functions, while the Logistics Director, Store Manager, Engineering Director, and Service Manager can focus on the specific needs of their respective areas. The Sales and Marketing Director and Purchasing Manager can work together to ensure that the company has a steady supply of materials and a steady stream of customers. The CFO and Human Resources Manager can provide support and guidance to all areas of the business, ensuring that the company operates efficiently and profitably.

卡勒德的企业已经涵盖了一些方面，而其他方面需要额外关注。然而，卡勒德已经制定了一个全面的计划，包括必要的步骤，他在一个下午的会议中就完成了这一计划，而没有产生昂贵的管理咨询费用。此外，他意识到可以通过ChatGPT进行进一步分析，并寻找与业务或扩张相关问题的答案。

如果卡勒德想要将他的新创业变成一个成功的企业，他需要一个坚实的战略、商业计划、愿景、使命和品牌。幸运的是，他也可以利用ChatGPT来发展这些方面。卡勒德可以再花一个下午的时间与ChatGPT合作制定一个全面的计划，几天后就可以开始实施。

## 结论

卡勒德的未来看起来很有前途，他可以通过利用ChatGPT获得额外的答案和资源来拓展自己的视野。
