- en: I began learning to program computers way back in 1981 in High School. The Data
    Processing teacher took pity on a young 9th grader and let me borrow time on the
    county's HP 2000 to teach myself BASIC. That experience grew into a passion for
    software development that has never waned.

    professionally in 1995\. I've been doing that ever since.
