    time, we were a leading e-commerce organisation, and it was a pretty exciting,
    high-tech environment.

    of my computer and then go and make a cup of tea. Typically, I would return to
    my desk in time to see the booting-up sequence finishing. I'd then enter my password,
    and have time to check my voicemail and say hello to colleagues before accessing
    my email.

    now for a computer to start up? The Mac I'm using to write this book takes less
    than a minute to be up and good to go, and sometimes I still find myself tapping
    my fingernails on the desk with impatience.

- en: Our relationship with time has undergone a drastic change in recent years. With
    the growth of technology and the increasing pace of life, we have become more
    and more impatient and intolerant of delays. What used to be considered a reasonable
    wait time has now been reduced to a matter of minutes, if not seconds.

    was commonplace. We were content to spend half an hour or more in line, engaging
    in conversation or simply enjoying the atmosphere.

    minutes can seem like an eternity. We have become accustomed to instant gratification,
    and anything less than that seems unacceptable.

    whole other level. Now, instead of taking an hour or two to craft a well-worded

    of work: working from home, working overseas and all the hybrid models in between.
    Now let''s throw in reduced working weeks, like nine-day fortnights or four-day
    work weeks, and we truly have a tool that can help us get things done quicker,
    allowing us that extra day of leisure.'

    another tool that helps you fill your day with even more meetings.
