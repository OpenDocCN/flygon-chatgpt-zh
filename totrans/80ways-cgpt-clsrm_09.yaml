- en: ChatGPT is a cutting-edge tool with the potential to revolutionize teaching
    and learning. However, to fully harness its power, the user must understand how
    to create effective prompts and evaluate results. Unfortunately, many educators
    are concerned that students need more foundational knowledge. This chapter explores
    strategies for shaping instruction to direct the use of ChatGPT in the classroom.
    Using these ideas, educators can ensure that students are equipped with the necessary
    skills to use ChatGPT effectively and maximize its potential to enhance learning
    outcomes.

- en: Faculty and students approach the purpose of writing from two different perspectives.
    Faculty see it as a way of thinking and learning, whereas students see it as a
    way to demonstrate knowledge and meet milestones.[^(28)](DsLqM8LuNcUFAQVy.xhtml#9G98a47fLyaG5O5J-endnote-1675042113993-text)
    Faculty are not average. They are two standard deviations from normal. I say this
    in jest, but faculty have bought into the education system, are experts in their
    discipline, and have come to understand the purpose of writing through their experiences.
    Students are skeptics and are still determining the path ahead.

    work rather than relying on artificial intelligence to do the work for them. In
    addition, faculty must refrain from assuming students know how to do research
    correctly and must model proper research methods. Teaching appropriate research
    methods may mean having fewer projects to work on and instead spending more time
    on the writing and rewriting process.

    thrown away with little to no impact on the students’ learning? Traditional “disposable
    assignments” are a waste of both students’ and instructors’ time and effort. However,
    there is an alternative - “renewable assignments.” These assignments have value
    beyond the grade, serving as a long-term resource for others to build upon and
    learn from.

    be motivated to work harder and learn more.

    ChatGPT has made it easier than ever to pull information together. What chatGPT
    cannot do well is make decisions without humans. Teach students how to set up
    the solutions for solving the problem. They can then hand the solution to others
    to collect the data and write the reports.

    present what they “know” without acknowledging those who contributed to their
    knowledge. If a student simply takes information from chatGPT without rewriting
    it or verifying it, the student does not add value to the conversation. Information
    literacy stresses the importance of dialogue as a form of scholarship. This means
    that we need to be teaching information literacy in every class.[^(32)](DsLqM8LuNcUFAQVy.xhtml#9G98a47fLyaG5O5J-endnote-1674005653679-text)

    ChatGPT would not have access to proprietary academic databases. Additionally,
    chatGPT does not have access to current events. Another point to consider is that
    chatGPT is a textual interface. It cannot “see” images or hear audio files. The
    more friction you introduce into the assignment, the less appealing it will be
    to use AI. It requires effort to write a prompt for chatGPT. The more work it
    needs, the fewer students will do it. Here are some ways you could craft assignments
    to minimize the use of AI.
