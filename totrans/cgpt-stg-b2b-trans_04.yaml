    digital age is an age of “saturation.” For the past several years, largely due

    media requests from people trying to sell them something. Customers now have their
    shields up all the time, and digital now helps them even block the same forces
    it created. Most of us don’t answer the phone if the call is identified as spam.
    We don’t check junk email. We don’t like giving out our email address. And we

- en: '**“Other people’s money.”** In B2B, the spending dynamic differs from B2C.
    While consumers normally spend their own money on themselves, B2B involves “spending
    other people’s money on other people,” borrowing a concept from famed economist
    Milton Friedman. This leads to a shift in buying criteria, where factors like
    quality and value are often outweighed by more personal factors. Decision-makers
    can often face additional work, change-management challenges, the need for consensus,
    and the risk of the personal consequences of bad decisions, all of which can deter
    them from adopting new solutions. The disconnect between personal costs and business
    benefits poses a difficult barrier for firms seeking to displace incumbent suppliers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Loss aversion.** Loss aversion, a concept from behavioral economics and prospect
    theory, significantly influences B2B decision-making. People tend to fear losses
    more than they value comparable gains. This aversion to losses creates a reluctance
    to deviate from the status quo. Switching to a new vendor or approach introduces
    personal risks, such as reputational damage or job insecurity, which normally
    outweigh the potential personal benefits. Fear of losses and the associated personal
    risks often hinder the adoption of new behaviors or solutions in the B2B space.
    Loss aversion and risk aversion are both much stronger forces in B2B than in B2C.
    The consequences of this reality are less-than-optimal decisions in B2B where
    “not losing” is vastly more influential than the prospect of winning. As an example,
    many of us over the age of forty have heard the phrase “Nobody gets fired for
    buying IBM,” a notion which perfectly captured this pervasive force.'

    self-interests and (2) the representative of the company’s interests. These two
    perspectives often have different decision drivers. While personal drivers often
    take precedence, decisions governed by the latter perspective also must be addressed.
    These are driven by logic, quantifiable impacts, and the bottom line. A successful
    B2B approach requires a combination of logic and emotion, appealing to both company
    and personal drivers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies often mismatch their sales-and-marketing messaging to the real drivers
    for B2B decisions. With a B2C mindset, they often market their products and services
    as if the decision-maker cared about their product or service the same way they
    might care about a new car, purse, or golf club. Brand marketing is more important
    and effective in B2C, where consumers care more deeply about the product they’re
    buying. However, while B2C marketing heavily relies on emotional connections and
    brand perceptions, B2B decisions are largely driven by personal-loss aversion
    and justifications based on the company’s performance. B2B customers frankly care
    less about the product itself and more about how it will impact them personally
    and/or benefit the company. Because of these key differences, lead generation
    and prospecting are vastly more important in B2B than brand marketing, especially
    for SMBs.

    a distinctly different approach than B2C. The resistance to change, the dominance
    of loss aversion, and the focus on bottom-line impacts shape the B2B decision-making
    process. As an important conclusion, B2B marketers should prioritize lead generation
    and prospecting over brand marketing, especially in SMBs. In modernizing and retailoring
    their sales and marketing, it’s imperative that firms understand these key differences

    vision. Incidentally, between taking the helms in 1986 and his departure in 2000,
