- en: We’ve seen how useful chatGPT can be, but like any machine learning model, it
    has its own set of limitations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**• ChatGPT''s training data cut-off date is 2021** and it does not have access
    to current events, which means it may not be able to understand or respond to
    events that have occurred after that date.'

- en: '**• There is an output limit for ChatGPT** on what it can generate in one response,
    you’ll know you’ve hit this limit if it stops generating a response mid-way through.
    If this happens, just type “Continue” and it will pick up from where it left off.'

- en: • You’re more likely to hit the limit when you ask open ended or complex questions.The
    output limit is a trade-off between the quality and relevance of the response
    and the computational cost of the model.

    to ensure a quality response.

    or irony, which can lead to misunderstandings or inappropriate responses.'

    in the training data can lead to bias in the model's responses.**

- en: • When using ChatGPT, it's important to remember that it doesn't keep any personal
    information but **it can use what you provide as input to generate text output.
    It's crucial to be aware of the potential privacy implications** by checking the
    privacy policy before providing any personal information.

- en: These are the limitations at the time of writing but chatGPT is constantly being
    improved and it’s thought that it’s only a matter of time till it can access current
    data.

- en: As with anything, do your own due diligence before publishing or making big
    decisions based on output generated from chatGPT.
