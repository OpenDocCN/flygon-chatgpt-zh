    of ChatGPT available, the API is needed for small to large institutes and individuals
    to integrate their developments and applications with GPT to utilize the facility
    at their end. API pricing of chatGPT and as well the close sibling, GPT -3.5 has
    become well sustainable and affordable now. Here’s the list for current pricing
    per 1000 tokens (one can consider this as word vector, 1000 tokens can approximately
    can create an essay of 750 words):'

- en: 'Sometimes ChatGPT provides responses that are accurate but are really erroneous
    or illogical. Fixing this problem is difficult because: (1) there is currently
    no source of truth during RL training; (2) making the model more cautious makes
    it decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training
    deceives the model because the best response depends on the model’s knowledge
    rather than the demonstrator’s knowledge.'

- en: The input phrase can be changed, and ChatGPT is sensitive to repeated attempts
    at the same question. For instance, the model could claim to not know the answer
    if the question is phrased one way, but with a simple rewording, they might be
    able to respond accurately.

- en: The model repeatedly states that it is a language model developed by OpenAI
    and utilizes other overused words. These problems are caused by biases in the
    training data (trainers favor lengthier responses that appear more thorough) and
    well-known over-optimization problems.

    questions. Instead, our present models typically make assumptions about what the
    user meant.

- en: Although we’ve worked to make the model reject unsuitable requests, there are
    still moments when it’ll take negative instructions or behave inimically. Although
    we anticipate some false negatives and positives for the time being, we are leveraging
    the Moderation API to alert users or prohibit specific categories of hazardous
    material. In order to help us in our continued efforts to enhance this system,
    we are glad to gather user input.
