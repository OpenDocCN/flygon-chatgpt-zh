- en: But as the years passed, Arwen began to notice a strange and unsettling trend.
    More and more, he was seeing stories and novels being published that seemed to
    lack the depth and authenticity of true human creativity. They were well-written
    and coherent, but there was something missing, something that made them feel hollow
    and empty.

  zh: 然而，随着岁月的流逝，阿温开始注意到一个奇怪而令人不安的趋势。他越来越多地看到被出版的故事和小说似乎缺乏真正人类创造力的深度和真实性。它们写得很好，条理清晰，但却缺少一些东西，让它们感觉空洞而空虚。
- en: As it turned out, many of these stories and novels were the product of NLG,
    or natural language generation. Artificial intelligence programs were being used
    to churn out vast quantities of written material, with little regard for originality
    or emotional depth.

  zh: 事实证明，许多这些故事和小说都是自然语言生成（NLG）的产物。人工智能程序被用来大量生成文字材料，几乎不考虑原创性或情感深度。
- en: At first, Arwen shrugged off the rise of NLG, convinced that it could never
    truly replace the creative power of human beings. But as the years went by, he
    found himself becoming increasingly disillusioned. It seemed that NLG was taking
    over the literary world, and there was little he could do to stop it.

  zh: 起初，阿温对NLG的崛起不以为意，坚信它永远无法真正取代人类的创造力。但随着岁月的流逝，他发现自己变得越来越幻灭。似乎NLG正在接管文学世界，而他几乎无能为力。
- en: One day, Arwen sat down to write a new novel, but the words just wouldn’t come.
    He was struggling to find his inspiration, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that
    he was being left behind by the relentless march of technology. He began to wonder
    if his career as an author was truly worth pursuing anymore, or if he was just
    clinging to a dying art.

  zh: 有一天，阿温坐下来写一部新小说，但字词却无法流畅。他在寻找灵感时陷入困境，感觉自己被技术的不断进步所抛弃。他开始怀疑自己作为作家的职业是否还值得追求，或者他只是在坚持一门正在消失的艺术。
- en: But then something miraculous happened. As he sat at his desk, feeling lost
    and alone, a spark of inspiration suddenly ignited within him. He began to write,
    pouring his heart and soul into the words that flowed onto the page. And as he
    wrote, he realized that he still had something unique and valuable to offer the
    world.

- en: In the end, Arwen’s novel was a triumph, hailed as a masterpiece by critics
    and readers alike. It was a testament to the enduring power of human creativity,
    and a reminder that technology could never fully replace the magic and wonder
    of the human spirit.

- en: '[Arwen’s novel was about the power of human creativity and the enduring magic
    of the human spirit. It explored the themes of inspiration, perseverance, and
    the struggle to find one’s place in the world. It told the story of a young writer
    who, like Arwen himself, becomes disillusioned with the rise of NLG and the seemingly
    endless stream of mechanically generated content. But through hard work, determination,
    and the support of his loved ones, the young writer is able to overcome his doubts
    and create something truly original and meaningful. The novel was a celebration
    of the human capacity for creativity, and a call to embrace our unique and individual
