    Simply paste the text from previous campaigns in the prompt and provide any necessary
    context or instructions for the copy. The past campaigns can serve as inspiration
    or a reference point for ChatGPT. That would be a nice feature to see in AI Copy
    platforms as it could be automated with referencing to past successful campaigns
    from Google/Meta or other Ad Serving Suites.

- en: When structuring a prompt for ChatGPT to produce a piece of content, there are
    several key parameters to keep in mind. First and foremost, be clear about the
    purpose of the copy and the target audience it’s intended for. Providing specific
    details about the audience can help ChatGPT create more relevant and engaging
    content. Additionally, indicating the desired tone and style can help set the
    appropriate context for the copy.

- en: Keywords or phrases are also important to include as they ensure that the content
    stays on topic and focused. Providing the desired length of the copy is helpful
    as well, whether it’s a specific word count or a general guideline. Finally, any
    additional instructions or requirements, such as incorporating specific branding
    or including a call to action, should be included in the prompt. While emojis
    can be a fun addition, it’s important to specify the level of usage based on the
    target audience. If the first output you get is not exactly what you expected
    please do not get disappointed and kindly ask the AI to repeat by mentioning again
    what it missed. Or ask for more and combine the answers later.
